    Applies a high pass filter to the data array to imporve
    proper integration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_array: `numpy.ndarray`
       An array containing data from to which filter
       is to be applied.

    cutoff: float
       The lowest frequency passed into the filter. Frequencies
       lower than the cutoff are removed from the dataset.

    sampling_frequency: float
       The maximum frequency passed into the filter based
       on the sampling rate of the data set.

    order: int
       The order of the filter created

    -------
    filt_arr: `numpy.ndarray`
       The original data aray with the frequencies below
       the cuttoff removed
