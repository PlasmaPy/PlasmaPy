class Tracker:
    r"""
    Represents a charged particle radiography experiment with simulated or
    calculated E and B fields given at positions defined by a grid of spatial
    coordinates. The particle source and detector plane are defined by vectors
    from the origin of the grid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid` or subclass thereof
        A Grid object containing the required quantities [E_x, E_y, E_z, B_x, B_y, B_z].
        If any of these quantities are missing, a warning will be given and that
        quantity will be assumed to be zero everywhere.

    source : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, shape (3)
        A vector pointing from the origin of the grid to the location
        of the particle source. This vector will be interpreted as
        being in either cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates
        based on its units. Valid geometries are:

        * Cartesian (x,y,z) : (meters, meters, meters)
        * cylindrical (r, theta, z) : (meters, radians, meters)
        * spherical (r, theta, phi) : (meters, radians, radians)

        In spherical coordinates theta is the polar angle.

    detector : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, shape (3)
        A vector pointing from the origin of the grid to the center
        of the detector plane. The vector from the source point to this
        point defines the normal vector of the detector plane. This vector
        can also be specified in cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical
        coordinates (see the ``source`` keyword).

    detector_hdir : `numpy.ndarray`, shape (3), optional
        A unit vector (in Cartesian coordinates) defining the horizontal
        direction on the detector plane. By default, the horizontal axis in the
        detector plane is defined to be perpendicular to both the
        source-to-detector vector and the z-axis (unless the source-to-detector axis
        is parallel to the z axis, in which case the horizontal axis is the x-axis).

        The detector vertical axis is then defined
        to be orthogonal to both the source-to-detector vector and the
        detector horizontal axis.

    verbose : bool, optional
        If true, updates on the status of the program will be printed
        into the standard output while running.

        Parameters
        ----------
        location : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, shape (3)
            A vector pointing from the origin of the grid to the center of the

            * cylindrical (r, theta, z) : (meters, radians, meters)
            * spherical (r, theta, phi) : (meters, radians, radians)

            In spherical coordinates theta is the polar angle.

        extent : Tuple of 1 or 2 `~astropy.units.Quantity`
            The size of the mesh grid (in the mesh plane). If one value
            is provided, the mesh is circular and the value provided is
            interpreted as the diameter. If two values are provided, the
            mesh is rectangular and the values are interpreted as the
            width and height respectively.

        nwires : Tuple of 1 or 2 ints, or a single int
            The number of wires in the horizontal and vertical directions. If
            only one value is provided, the number in the two directions is
            assumed to be equal. Note that a wire will cross the center of the
            mesh only when nwires is odd.

        wire_diameter : `~astropy.units.Quantity`
            The diameter of the wires.

        mesh_hdir : `numpy.ndarray`, shape (3), optional
            A unit vector (in Cartesian coordinates) defining the horizontal
            direction on the mesh plane. Modifying this vector can rotate the
            mesh in the plane or tilt the mesh plane relative to the
            source-detector axis. By default, ``mesh_hdir`` is set equal to
            ``detector_hdir`` (see ``detector_hdir`` keyword in ``__init__``).

        mesh_vdir : `numpy.ndarray`, shape (3), optional
            A unit vector (in Cartesian coordinates) defining the vertical

        Generates the angular distributions about the Z-axis, then

        By default, particles are generated over almost the entire pi/2. However,
        if the detector is far from the source, many of these particles will
        never be observed. The max_theta keyword allows these extraneous
        particles to be neglected to focus computational resources on the
        particles who will actually hit the detector.

        Parameters
        ----------

        nparticles : integer
            The number of particles to include in the simulation. The default
            is 1e5.

        particle_energy : `~astropy.units.Quantity`
            The energy of the particle, in units convertible to eV.
            All particles are given the same energy.

        max_theta : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
            The largest velocity vector angle (measured from the
            source-to-detector axis) for which particles should be generated.
            Decreasing this angle can eliminate particles that would never
            reach the detector region of interest. If no value is given, a
            guess will be made based on the size of the grid.
            Units must be convertible to radians.

        particle : ~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle or string representation of same, optional
            Representation of the particle species as either a |Particle| object
            or a string representation. The default particle is protons.

        distribution: str
            A keyword which determines how particles will be distributed
            in velocity space. Options are:

                - 'monte-carlo': velocities will be chosen randomly,
                    such that the flux per solid angle is uniform.

                - 'uniform': velocities will be distributed such that,
                   left unperturbed,they will form a uniform pattern
                   on the detection plane. This method
                   requires that ``nparticles`` be a perfect square. If it is not,
                   ``nparticles`` will be set as the largest perfect square smaller
                   than the provided ``nparticles``.

            Simulations run in the ``'uniform'`` mode will imprint a grid pattern
            on the image, but will well-sample the field grid with a
            smaller number of particles. The default is ``'monte-carlo'``.

        r"""
        Runs a particle-tracing simulation.
        Timesteps are adaptively calculated based on the
        local grid resolution of the particles and the electric and magnetic
        fields they are experiencing. After all particles
        have left the grid, they are advanced to the
        detector plane where they can be used to construct a synthetic
        diagnostic image.

        Parameters
        ----------

        dt : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
            An explicitly set timestep in units convertible to seconds.
            Setting this optional keyword overrules the adaptive time step
            capability and forces the use of this timestep throughout. If a tuple
            of timesteps is provided, the adaptive timestep will be clamped
            between the first and second values.

        field_weighting : str
            String that selects the field weighting algorithm used to determine
            what fields are felt by the particles. Options are:

            * 'nearest neighbor': Particles are assigned the fields on
                the grid vertex closest to them.

            * 'volume averaged' : The fields experienced by a particle are a
                volume-average of the eight grid points surrounding them.

            The default is 'volume averaged'.
