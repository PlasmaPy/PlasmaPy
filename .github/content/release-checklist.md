This issue contains the procedure for releasing a new version of PlasmaPy.

### Planning the release

- [x] [Create an issue for the release]. ‚úÖ
- [ ] Update [milestones] for issues & pull requests (PRs). üõ£Ô∏è

### Code quality updates (optional, but recommended)

- [ ] ~~Revise changelog entries to make sure that they are understandable, necessary, and correctly categorized. Add the `no changelog entry needed` label to skip doing changelog checks. üìú~~
- [ ] Run the [GitHub Action for checking hyperlinks] üîó, and update broken links. Use `linkcheck_allowed_redirects` in [`docs/conf.py`] to allow redirects (e.g., from `doi.org`). Update or delete the `alias` field for authors in [`CITATION.cff`] who have changed their GitHub username.
- [ ] Run `git log --format="%aN <%aE>" | sort -u`, and update [`.mailmap`] if there are any duplicate contributors in the output. üìß
- [ ] [Update pinned requirements]. üìç
- [ ] Run `pre-commit autoupdate` followed by `pre-commit run --all-files`. Fix any new errors and commit the changes.

> [!CAUTION]
> As of mid-2025, keep the `pre-commit-search-and-replace` at `v1.0.5` and keep `typos` at a specific version rather than rolling back to `v1`.

### Perform the release

- [ ] Begin an upload to [Zenodo] for a new version of [this record], using the `team@plasmapy.org` login. Reserve a DOI. üè∑Ô∏è
- [ ] Run the GitHub workflow to [prepare a release], specifying the version (i.e., `2025.8.0`) and copying the reserved DOI from Zenodo. This workflow will create a pull request that builds the changelog and updates package metadata.
  - [ ] Revise changelog entries to make sure that they are understandable, necessary, and correctly categorized. üìú
  - [ ] Make sure the pull request is
  - [ ] Merge the pull request.
- [ ] Run the [tests]. [![CI](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
- [ ] Run the [weekly tests]. [![weekly tests](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/weekly.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/weekly-tests.yml)
- [ ] [Create a release on GitHub]. üöÄ
  - Choose the newly created tag (e.g., `v2024.10.0`), and use it as the title. (The release will be performed from the tag, so it is not necessary to select the branch.) üè∑Ô∏è
  - Set the tag for the previous release, and select the option to automatically generate release notes. üìú
  - Select the option to create a discussion for the release under the _General_ category.
  - For official releases, make sure the checkbox is selected for _Set as the latest release_. For beta releases or release candidates (e.g., `v2024.10.0rc1`), specify it as a pre-release.
  - Click on _Publish release_, which will create the GitHub release and trigger the GitHub workflow to [publish to PyPI]. üöÄ
  - Check the [release history] on PyPI to make sure that the release was successful. üÜï

### Following the release

- [ ] Download a `.tar.gz` file of the tagged release from the [list of tagged versions] on GitHub, and upload it to [Zenodo].
  - [ ] Update the version number and release date in the record.
  - [ ] Update the author list with new authors from the automatically generated release notes or [`CITATION.cff`].
  - [ ] Update the bibliography.
  - [ ] Publish the record.
- [ ] Fix any problems with the automated pull request to [conda-forge feedstock], if necessary. This step should be automatic, but may take a while.
- [ ] Update requirements in the [conda-forge feedstock] in `recipe/meta.yaml`, in particular when there is a new version of Python.

> [!TIP]
> To compare two files across different tags, use commands like:
>
> ```shell
> git diff v2024.7.0:CITATION.cff v2024.10.0:CITATION.cff
> git diff v2024.7.0:docs/bibliography.bib v2024.10.0:docs/bibliography.bib
> ```

### Update documentation

- [ ] Delete the [`stable`] branch on GitHub if it exists.
- [ ] Activate the current and prior release on the [versions page on RTD], if necessary. If the documentation fails to build for a release, activate the corresponding branch (e.g., activate the `v2023.10.x` branch instead of the `v2023.10.0` tag).
- [ ] Verify that the [citation page] is up-to-date and the DOI link points to the most recent release.
- [ ] Check that the [documentation] builds correctly for the release branch.

> [!TIP]
> If the documentation build fails, create a new [`stable`] branch from the release branch (e.g., `2024.10.x`) and fix any problems with the documentation build. The [`stable`] branch is needed if the documentation build for the release fails or if we make any changes to the documentation between releases. The [stable documentation build] will point to the [`stable`] branch on GitHub if it exists. Otherwise, it will point to the most recent release on GitHub. üìö

## Test the release

- [ ] After activating a new virtual or conda environment, make sure that the released version installs correctly with `pip install --upgrade plasmapy`.
- [ ] Open Python and run `import plasmapy`, `dir(plasmapy)`, and `plasmapy.__version__`.
- [ ] Run `plasma-calculator` from the command line.
- [ ] Verify that the new version can be installed with conda.
- [ ] Verify that the new version can be installed with uv.

## After the release

- [ ] Announce the release at the [community meeting].
- [ ] Update the [release checklist], as needed.
  - An example changelog entry is: "Updated the release checklist following the `v2024.10.0` release."
- [ ] [Create an issue for the release] to occur in ‚àº3‚Äì4 months.
- [ ] Close this issue.
