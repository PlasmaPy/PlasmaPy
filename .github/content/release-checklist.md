This issue is created from the [release checklist] for releasing a new version of PlasmaPy.

### Planning the release

- [x] [Create an issue for the release]. üìù
- [ ] Update [milestones] for issues & pull requests (PRs). üõ£Ô∏è

### Quality assurance checks (low priority)

- [ ] Run the [GitHub Action for checking hyperlinks], and update broken links. Use `linkcheck_allowed_redirects` in [`docs/conf.py`] to allow redirects (e.g., from `doi.org`). Update or delete the `alias` field for authors in [`CITATION.cff`] who have changed their GitHub username. [![linkcheck](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/linkcheck.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/linkcheck.yml)
- [ ] Run `git log --format="%aN <%aE>" | sort -u`, and update [`.mailmap`] if there are any duplicate contributors in the output ([gitmailmap documentation]). üì´

### Quality assurance checks (high priority)

- [ ] [Update pinned requirements] in `uv.lock`, and fix new test failures. üìç

- [ ] Run `pre-commit autoupdate` followed by `pre-commit run --all-files`. Fix new errors and commit the changes. [![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/main)

  - Occasionally, certain hooks may need to be manually downgraded after running `pre-commit autoupdate` because of problems with the latest versions of these hooks. Look for comments in [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`] for guidance. ü™ù

- [ ] Run the [upstream tests] and fix failures, as appropriate. These checks run tests and build documentation against unreleased versions of core dependencies. [![upstream tests](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/ci-upstream.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/ci-upstream.yml)

### Perform the release

- [ ] Begin an upload to [Zenodo] for a new version of [this record], using the `team@plasmapy.org` login. Reserve a DOI. üî¢

- [ ] Run the GitHub workflow to [prepare a release], specifying the version (i.e., `2026.1.0`) and copying the reserved DOI from Zenodo. This workflow will create a PR that builds the changelog and updates package metadata. ü§ñ [![prepare release PR](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/prepare-release-pr.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/prepare-release-pr.yml)

  - [ ] Revise changelog entries to make sure that they are understandable, necessary, and correctly categorized. üìú
  - [ ] Make sure that all tests are passing in the PR. ‚úÖ
  - [ ] Merge the PR. üì¶

- [ ] Run the [tests]. [![tests](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

- [ ] Run the [comprehensive tests]. [![comprehensive tests](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/ci-comprehensive.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/ci-comprehensive.yml) üîç

- [ ] [Create a release on GitHub]. üöÄ

  - [ ] Choose the newly created tag (e.g., `v2026.1.0`), and use it as the title. (The release will be performed from the tag, so it is not necessary to select the branch.) üè∑Ô∏è
  - [ ] Set the tag for the previous release, and select the option to automatically generate release notes. üìú
  - [ ] Select the option to create a discussion for the release under the _General_ category. üì£
  - [ ] For official releases, choose _Set as the latest release_. For beta releases or release candidates (e.g., `v2026.1.0rc1`), specify it as a pre-release. üÜï
  - [ ] Click on <kbd>Publish release</kbd>, which will create the GitHub release and trigger the GitHub workflow to [publish to PyPI]. [![publish](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml)
  - [ ] Check the [release history] on PyPI to make sure that the release was successful. [![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/plasmapy?style=flat&logo=pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/plasmapy/) [![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/plasmapy?style=flat&logo=python)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/plasmapy?style=plastic)

### Upload release to Zenodo

- [ ] Download a `.tar.gz` file of the tagged release from the [list of tagged versions] on GitHub, and upload it to [Zenodo]. üì§
  - [ ] Update the version number and release date in the record. üìÖ
  - [ ] Update the author list with new authors from the automatically generated release notes or [`CITATION.cff`]. üë•
  - [ ] Update the bibliography. üìñ
  - [ ] Publish the record. üèõÔ∏è

> [!TIP]
> To compare two files across different tags, use commands like:
>
> ```shell
> git diff v2024.7.0:CITATION.cff v2024.10.0:CITATION.cff
> git diff v2024.7.0:docs/bibliography.bib v2024.10.0:docs/bibliography.bib
> ```

### Documentation

- [ ] Delete the [`stable`] branch on GitHub if it exists. üóëÔ∏è
- [ ] Verify that the current and previous release are activated on the [versions page on RTD]. üìö [![Read the Docs Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/plasmapy/badge/?version=latest)](http://plasmapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
- [ ] Verify that the [citation page] is up-to-date and the DOI link points to the most recent release. üßæ

## Availability on conda-forge

Within a day, an automated PR will be made to PlasmaPy's [conda-forge feedstock], which will require updates if any requirements have changed.

- [ ] Update [`recipe/meta.yaml`] to match [`pyproject.toml`] in the release. üîß
- [ ] Verify that `python_min` near the beginning of [`recipe/meta.yaml`] is consistent with `requires-python` [`pyproject.toml`]. üêç
- [ ] Merge the PR to the conda-forge feedstock. üöÄ
- [ ] Verify that the new version shows up on conda-forge. üì¶ [![Conda version](https://img.shields.io/conda/v/conda-forge/plasmapy?style=flat&logo=anaconda)](https://img.shields.io/conda/v/conda-forge/plasmapy)

> [!TIP]
> If the documentation build fails, fix any problems with the RTD build and create a new [`stable`] branch from the release. The [stable documentation build] will point to the `stable` branch on GitHub if it exists. Otherwise, it will point to the most recent release on GitHub. An alternative would be to fix the problem on `main` and perform a patch release. Because the release process has changed since we needed a `stable` branch, please update the [release checklist] accordingly.

## Test releases

- [ ] Run the [installability tests] to make sure that the new version of PlasmaPy can be installed via pip, uv, and conda-forge. [![installability tests](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/installability.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/actions/workflows/installability.yml)

## After the release

- [ ] Update the [release checklist], if necessary. üìã
- [ ] [Create an issue for the next release], and then [pin the issue]. ‚è≥
- [ ] Close the issue and celebrate. üéÜ
