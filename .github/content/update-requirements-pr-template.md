This pull request (PR) regenerates the requirements files in [`uv.lock`] that are used for running tests, building documentation, and performing continuous integration (CI) checks. Pinning requirements files reduces the probability that a CI check will spontaneously start failing in a PR due to a breaking change in a dependency. This PR lets us quarantine breaking changes in newly released dependencies before they get used in CI. ðŸ›¡

**If all checks pass âœ…, please merge this PR.** If any checks fail due to a breaking change in a dependency ðŸš¨, please fix the problem(s) before merging.

> [!NOTE]
> These changes were generated by running `nox -s requirements` in the top-level directory of the repository, using the `requirements` session defined in [`noxfile.py`]. This [Nox] session uses `uv lock` to regenerate requirements files. The workflow is defined in [`.github/workflows/update-pinned-reqs.yml`].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When it is necessary to pin or put an upper limit on a requirement in [`pyproject.toml`], please [create an issue] to remove this upper limit before the next release.
