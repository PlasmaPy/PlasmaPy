This pull request (PR) regenerates [`uv.lock`]: the cross-platform lockfile that exactly specifies the Python environments used when running tests, building documentation, and performing continuous integration (CI) checks.

**If all checks pass ✅, please merge this PR.** If any checks fail due to a breaking change in a dependency 🚨, please address the problems before merging.

> [!NOTE]
> These changes were generated by running `nox -s lock` in the top-level directory of the repository, using the `lock` session defined in [`noxfile.py`]. This [Nox] session uses [`uv lock`] to update `uv.lock` with a [dependency cooldown]. The workflow is defined in [`.github/workflows/update-uv-lock.yml`].

> [!TIP]
> Locking requirements reduces the probability that a CI check will spontaneously start failing in a PR due to a breaking change in an upstream dependency. This PR lets us quarantine breaking changes in newly released dependencies before they get used in CI. 🛡

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When it is necessary to put an upper limit on a requirement in [`pyproject.toml`], please [create an issue] to remove this upper limit before the next release.
