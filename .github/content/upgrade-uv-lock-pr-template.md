## Instructions

**If all checks pass ✅, please merge this pull request.** If any checks fail due to a breaking change in a dependency 🚨, please address the problems before merging.

## Description

This pull request upgrades [`uv.lock`]: the cross-platform lockfile that specifies the Python environments used when running tests, building documentation, and performing continuous integration (CI) checks. Locking requirements lets us prevent spontaneous test failures due to breaking changes in upstream dependencies. This PR lets us quarantine breaking changes in newly released dependencies before they get used in CI.

These changes were generated by running `nox -s lock` in the top-level directory of the repository, using the `lock` session defined in [`noxfile.py`]. This [Nox] session uses [`uv lock --upgrade`] to upgrade `uv.lock` with a [dependency cooldown].
