            The bottom of this page shows several checks that are run for every PR. Don't worry if something broke! We break stuff all the time. 😺 Click on "Details" to learn why a check didn't pass. Please also feel free to ask for help. We do that all the time as well. 🌸 You can find us in our [**chat room**](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/contributing/coding_guide.html) or weekly [**community meeting**](https://www.plasmapy.org/meetings/weekly) & [**office hours**](https://www.plasmapy.org/meetings/office_hours). Here are some tips:

             - Try fixing **CI / Python 3.12** test failures first.
             - Most **pre-commit.ci - pr** failures can be automagically fixed by commenting \`pre-commit.ci autofix\` below, followed by a \`git pull\` to bring the changes back to your computer. Please also see our [pre-commit troubleshooting guide](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/contributing/pre-commit.html#troubleshooting-pre-commit-failures).
             - If **pre-commit.ci - pr** says that a function is too long or complex, try breaking up that function into multiple short functions that each do one thing. See also these tips on [**writing clean scientific software**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3922956).
             - If the **CI / Documentation** check ends with a cryptic error message, check out our [documentation troubleshooting guide](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/contributing/doc_guide.html#troubleshooting).
             - For a documentation preview, click on *Details* next to **docs/readthedocs.org:plasmapy**.

            If this PR is marked as ready for review, someone should stop by to provide a code review and offer suggestions soon. ✅ If you don't get a review within a few days, please feel free to send us a reminder.

            Please also use SI units within PlasmaPy, except when there is strong justification otherwise or in some examples.

            We thank you once again!`
