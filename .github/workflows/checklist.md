Thank you for contributing to PlasmaPy! The project's future depends
deeply on contributors like you, so we deeply appreciate it! 🌱 The
following checklist will be used by the code reviewer to help guide the
code review process.

- Overall
  - [ ] Does the PR do what it intends to do?
  - [ ] Except for very minor changes, is a changelog entry included and
        consistent with the [changelog guide]?
  - [ ] Are the continuous integration checks passing? (Most linter
        problems can be automagically fixed by commenting on this PR
        with `pre-commit.ci autofix`.)
- Code
  - [ ] Is new/updated code understandable and consistent with the
        [coding guide]?
  - [ ] Are there ways to greatly simplify the implementation?
  - [ ] Are there any large functions that should be split up into
        shorter functions?
- Tests
  - [ ] Are tests added/updated as required, and consistent with the
        [testing guide]?
  - [ ] Are the tests understandable?
  - [ ] Do the tests cover all important cases?
  - [ ] Are any added/updated lines of code not covered by tests, but
        should be?
- Docs
  - [ ] Are docs added/updated as required, and consistent with the [doc
        guide]?
  - [ ] Are the docs understandable?
  - [ ] Do the docs show up correctly in the preview, including
        Jupyter notebooks?
