Please also feel free to ask for help. We do that all the time as well. 🌸 You can find us in our [**chat room**](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/contributing/coding_guide.html) or weekly [**community meeting**](https://www.plasmapy.org/meetings/weekly) & [**office hours**](https://www.plasmapy.org/meetings/office_hours).

             - Try fixing *CI/Python 3.11* test failures first.
             - Most *pre-commit.ci* failures can be automagically fixed by commenting "pre-commit.ci autofix" below, followed by a \`git pull\`.
             - In the *CI/Documentation* ends with a cryptic error message, check out our [documentation troubleshooting guide](https://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/contributing/doc_guide.html#troubleshooting).
