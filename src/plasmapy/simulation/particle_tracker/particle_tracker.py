class ParticleTracker:
    r"""A particle tracker for particles in electric and magnetic fields without inter-particle interactions.

    Particles are instantiated and pushed through a grid of provided E and
    B fields using the Boris push algorithm. These fields are specified as
    part of a grid which are then interpolated to determine the local field
    acting on each particle.

    The time step used in the push routine can be specified, or an adaptive
    time step will be determined based off the gyroradius of the particle.
    Some save routines involve time stamping the location and velocities of
    particles at fixed intervals. In order for this data to be coherent, it
    is required that all particles follow the same time step. This is
    referred to as a synchronized time step. If no time step is specified
    and the provided save routine does not require a synchronized time step,
    then an adaptive time step is calculated independently for each particle.

    The simulation will push particles through the provided fields until a
    condition is met. This termination condition is provided as an instance
    of the `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.termination_conditions.AbstractTerminationCondition`
    class as arguments to the simulation constructor. The results of a simulation
    can be exported by specifying an instance of the `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.save_routines.AbstractSaveRoutine`
    class to the ``run`` method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grids : An instance of `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid`
        A Grid object or list of grid objects containing the required quantities.
        The list of required quantities varies depending on other keywords.

    termination_condition : `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.termination_conditions.AbstractTerminationCondition`
        An subclass of `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.termination_conditions.AbstractTerminationCondition` which determines when the simulation has finished.
        See `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.termination_conditions.AbstractTerminationCondition` for more details.

    save_routine : `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.save_routines.AbstractSaveRoutine`, optional
        An subclass of `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.save_routines.AbstractSaveRoutine` which determines which
        time steps of the simulation to save. The default is `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.save_routines.DoNotSaveSaveRoutine`.
        See `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.save_routines.AbstractSaveRoutine` for more details.

    particle_integrator : `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_integrators.AbstractIntegrator`, optional
        An subclass of `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_integrators.AbstractIntegrator` that is responsible for implementing the push behavior
        of the simulation when provided the electric and magnetic fields. The default value is set to `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_integrators.RelativisticBorisIntegrator`.
        See `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_integrators.AbstractIntegrator` for more information on how to implement custom push routines.

    dt : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
        An explicitly set time step in units convertible to seconds.
        Setting this optional keyword overrules the adaptive time step
        capability and forces the use of this time step throughout.

    dt_range : tuple of shape (2,) of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
        If specified, the calculated adaptive time step will be clamped
        between the first and second values.

    field_weighting : str
        String that selects the field weighting algorithm used to determine
        what fields are felt by the particles. Options are:

        * 'nearest neighbor': Particles are assigned the fields on
            the grid vertex closest to them.
        * 'volume averaged' : The fields experienced by a particle are a
            volume-average of the eight grid points surrounding them.

        The default is 'volume averaged'.

    req_quantities : `list` of `str`, default : `None`
        A list of quantity keys required to be specified on the Grid object.
        The base particle pushing simulation requires the quantities
        [E_x, E_y, E_z, B_x, B_y, B_z]. This keyword is for specifying
        quantities in addition to these six. If any required
        quantities are missing, those quantities will be assumed to be zero
        everywhere. A warning will be raised if any of the additional
        required quantities are missing and are set to zero.

    verbose : bool, optional
        If true, updates on the status of the program will be printed
        into the standard output while running. The default is True.

    Warns
    -----
    `~plasmapy.utils.exceptions.RelativityWarning`
        The provided integrator does not account for relativistic corrections
        and particles have reached a non-negligible fraction of the speed of
        light.

    Notes
    -----
    We adopt the convention of ``NaN`` values to represent various states of a particle.

    If the particle's position and velocity are not ``NaN``, the particle is being tracked and evolved.
    If the particle's position is not ``NaN``, but the velocity is ``NaN``, the particle has been stopped
    (i.e. it is still in the simulation but is no longer evolved.)
    If both the particle's position and velocity are set to ``NaN``, then the particle has been removed from the simulation.

        how many times the orbit of a gyrating particles will be subdivided. The other candidate,
        associated with the spatial resolution of the grid object, calculates a time step using the time
        it would take the fastest particle to cross some fraction of a grid cell length. This fraction is the Courant number.
