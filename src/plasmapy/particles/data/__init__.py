Data used in constructing `plasmapy.particles`.

There are currently three datasets, :file:`elements.json`,
:file:`isotopes.json`, and :file:`ionization_energy.json`. :file:`elements.json` contains element/atomic
data that is loaded by the functionality contained in
``plasmapy.particles._elements``. :file:`isotopes.json` contains isotope
data that is loaded by the functionality contained in
``plasmapy.particles._isotopes``. :file:`ionization_energy.json` contains ionization energy
data that is loaded by the functionality contained in
``plasmapy.particles._ionization_energy``.
