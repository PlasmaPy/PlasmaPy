If you use PlasmaPy for a project that results in a publication, we ask
that you cite the Zenodo_ record for the specific version of PlasmaPy
used in your project.  Citing a software package promotes scientific
reproducibility, gives credit to its developers, and highlights the
importance of software as a vital research product.

Version |version_to_cite| of PlasmaPy may be cited with the following
reference:

   PlasmaPy Community et al. (|citation_year|). *PlasmaPy*, version
   |version_to_cite|, Zenodo, |doi_hyperlink|

This reference may be made, for example, by adding the following line to
the methods or acknowledgments section of a paper.

   This research made use of PlasmaPy version |version_to_cite|, a
   community-developed open source Python package for plasma research
   and education (PlasmaPy Community et al. |citation_year|).

A paper written using `AASTeX <https://journals.aas.org/aastexguide>`__
should use the ``\software{PlasmaPy}`` command to cite PlasmaPy.

All public releases of PlasmaPy, as well as many informational resources
on PlasmaPy, are openly archived in the `PlasmaPy Community
<https://zenodo.org/communities/plasmapy>`__ on Zenodo_.

We encourage authors to acknowledge the packages that PlasmaPy depends
on, including but not limited to
`Astropy <https://www.astropy.org/acknowledging.html>`__,
`NumPy <https://numpy.org/citing-numpy>`__, and
`SciPy <https://scipy.org/citing-scipy>`__.

.. important::

   A development version of PlasmaPy should not be cited or used in
   published work.
