   vision statement when it was originally hosted on Google Docs.  Some
   of the people who made commits do not show up as contributors on the
   GitHub page, so it is important to check the git log as well to make
   sure we are not missing anyone.

Acknowledgements
================

The PlasmaPy community thanks the SunPy_ and |Astropy| communities for
inspiring this project in the first place, providing much helpful
advice, and showing examples of how to build a community-wide open
source scientific software package. The PlasmaPy community also thanks
BaPSF_, `The Carpentries`_, CRANE_, Fair4Fusion_, MagNetUS_, OLUG_,
OMFIT_, Pathways to Fusion, `Open Astronomy`_ pyOpenSci_, the `Python in
Heliophysics Community`_, the SULI_ program at PPPL_, and US-RSE_.

Early development on PlasmaPy was partially supported by the U.S.
Department of Energy through grant DE-SC0016363 that was funded through
the NSF-DOE Partnership on Basic Plasma Science and Engineering; a
Scholarly Studies grant awarded by the Smithsonian Institution; Google
Summer of Code; and NASA Heliophysics Data Environment Enhancements
(HDEE) grant 80NSSC20K0174. PlasmaPy development from October 2019 to
September 2025 was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation
(NSF) through grants 1931388, 1931393, 1931429, and 1931435 that were
awarded via a `collaborative proposal`_ submitted to NSF's
`Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation`_ (CSSI) program.
`PlasmaPy infrastructure and maintenance`_ from August 2025 through
July 2028 for two person-months per year is supported by NASA
Heliophysics Tools and Methods grant 80NSSC25K0360 to the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory.
