.. This list contains contributors to the core package as well as to the
   vision statement when it was originally hosted on Google Docs.  Some
   of the people who made commits do not show up as contributors on the
   GitHub page, so it is important to check the git log as well to make
   sure we are not missing anyone.

Department of Energy through grant DE-SC0016363 that was funded
through the NSF-DOE Partnership on Basic Plasma Science and
Engineering; a Scholarly Studies grant awarded by the Smithsonian
Institution; Google Summer of Code; and NASA Heliophysics Data
Environment Enhancements (HDEE) grant 80NSSC20K0174.  PlasmaPy is
being developed with support from the U.S. National Science Foundation
through grants 1931388, 1931393, 1931429, and 1931435 that were awarded
through `a collaborative proposal
