Acknowledgements
================

The PlasmaPy community thanks the SunPy_ and |Astropy| communities for
inspiring this project in the first place, providing much helpful
advice, and showing examples of how to build a community-wide open
source scientific software package. The PlasmaPy community also thanks
BaPSF_, `The Carpentries`_, CRANE_, Fair4Fusion_, MagNetUS_, OLUG_,
OMFIT_, Pathways to Fusion, `Open Astronomy`_ pyOpenSci_, the `Python in
Heliophysics Community`_, the SULI_ program at PPPL_, and US-RSE_.

Early development on PlasmaPy was partially supported by the U.S.
Department of Energy through grant DE-SC0016363 that was funded through
the NSF-DOE Partnership on Basic Plasma Science and Engineering; a
Scholarly Studies grant awarded by the Smithsonian Institution; Google
Summer of Code; and NASA Heliophysics Data Environment Enhancements
(HDEE) grant 80NSSC20K0174. PlasmaPy is being developed with support
from the U.S. National Science Foundation through grants 1931388,
1931393, 1931429, and 1931435 that were awarded through `a collaborative
proposal
<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3406803>`__ submitted to the
Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) program.
