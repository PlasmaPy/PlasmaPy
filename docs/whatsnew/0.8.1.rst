Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- In `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density`, the arguments
  ``Te`` and ``Ti`` have been renamed ``T_e`` and ``T_i`` and are now
  required |keyword-only| arguments. (`#974
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/974>`__)
- Moved the ``grid_resolution`` attribute from
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid` to
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid` and
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.NonUniformCartesianGrid` separately. This
  fixes a potential future bug, because this attribute is only valid
  as written when all axes share the same units. (`#1295
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1295>`__)
- Changed the behavior of the ``__repr__`` method of |CustomParticle|
  to display the symbol as well if it was provided. (`#1397
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1397>`__)
- Removed a block of code that printed out special particle properties
  when ``plasmapy.particles.special_particles`` (renamed to
  ``plasmapy.particles._special_particles``) was executed. (`#1440
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1440>`__)
- Renamed ``plasmapy.particles.elements`` to
  ``plasmapy.particles._elements``, ``plasmapy.particles.isotopes`` to
  ``plasmapy.particles._isotopes``, ``plasmapy.particles.parsing`` to
  ``plasmapy.particles._parsing``, and
  ``plasmapy.particles.special_particles`` to
  ``plasmapy.particles._special_particles``. Consequently, these
  modules are no longer part of PlasmaPy's public API. Most of these
  modules did not contain any public objects, except for
  ``plasmapy.particles.special_particles.ParticleZoo`` which was
  renamed to ``plasmapy.particles._special_particles.particle_zoo``
  and removed from the public API. (`#1440
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1440>`__)
- The parameters ``Z`` and ``mass_numb`` to |Particle| are now
  |keyword-only|. (`#1456
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1456>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Officially deprecated `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` and scheduled
  its permanent removal for the ``v0.9.0`` release. (`#1453
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1453>`__)
- Dropped support for Python 3.7 in accordance with the deprecation
  policy laid out in `NumPy Enhancement Proposal 29
  <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`__. (`#1465
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1465>`__)
- The ``[all]`` option when using pip_ to install `plasmapy` is now
  deprecated and may be removed in a future release. Packages that
  were previously optional (|h5py|_, |lmfit|, |mpmath|_, and |numba|_)
  are now installed by default when running ``pip install
  plasmapy``. To install all packages required for code development of
  PlasmaPy, instead run ``pip install plasmapy[developer]``. (`#1482
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Removed ``plasmapy.optional_deps``. (`#1482
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)


Features
--------

- `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density` and
  `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density_model` now support
  `~plasmapy.particles.particle_collections` objects as input to the
  ``ions`` keywords. (`#974
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/974>`__)
- Created a :term:`lite-function` for
  `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density`,
  `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density_lite`. (`#974
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/974>`__)
- Added a fitting function for 1D spectra,
  `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density_model`, to the
  Thomson scattering diagnostic module. (`#974
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/974>`__)
- Created function
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_coefficients`` to
  support ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_lite`` usage
  by calculating the various thermal speed coefficients.
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_coefficients`` is also
  bound to ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed`` as the
  ``coefficients`` attribute. (`#1145
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Created decorator
  `~plasmapy.utils.decorators.lite_func.bind_lite_func` for handling
  the binding of :term:`lite-functions` and any supporting functions
  to a parent function. (`#1145
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Introduced the concept of :term:`lite-functions`, by creating the
  lite-function ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_lite``,
  which is a simplified and Numba_ jitted version of
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed``.  These functions
  are intended for computational use and as such have no validation of
  input or output values.
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_lite`` is also bound
  to ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed`` as the ``lite``
  attribute. (`#1145
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Added the :file:`hollweg_.py` module to the
  `~plasmapy.dispersion.numerical` subpackage to numerically solve the
  dispersion relation using Hollweg's method
  :cite:p:`hollweg:1999,bellan:2012`. (`#1189
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1189>`__)
- Implemented non-breaking speed improvements on the methods
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid.nearest_neighbor_interpolator`
  and
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid.volume_averaged_interpolator`
  for `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid`. The new interpolators
  now require that the grid axes be sorted, which is always true for
  uniform grids. Added a new test to ensure this stays true. (`#1295
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1295>`__)
- Refactored the interpolator methods on objects defined in
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids`.  All interpolators are now defined in the
  subclasses of `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid`.  Calling the
  interpolator methods on `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid` raises
  a `NotImplementedError` exception. (`#1295
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1295>`__)
- Created :term:`lite-function`
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.plasma_frequency_lite``. (`#1308
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1308>`__)
- Added the `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.molecule` function to
  build |CustomParticle| objects from a `str` representing a molecule
  symbol. (`#1309 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1309>`__)
- Added the
  `~plasmapy.particles.particle_collections.ParticleList.is_category`
  method for |ParticleList| objects.  This method is analogous to the
  `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle.is_category` method for
  |Particle| objects. (`#1378
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1378>`__)
- Created the prototype analysis tool `plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint`
  for finding the null points in a vector space using the trilinear
  interpolation method of :cite:t:`haynes:2007`. (`#1383
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1383>`__)
- Created `plasmapy.formulary.lengths` to contain length related
  plasma parameters, and migrated
  `~plasmapy.formulary.lengths.Debye_length`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.lengths.gyroradius`, and
  `~plasmapy.formulary.lengths.inertial_length` from
  `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` to the new module.  Related aliases
  were also migrated. (`#1434
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1434>`__)
- Created `plasmapy.formulary.frequencies` to contain frequency
  related plasma parameters, and migrated
  `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.gyrofrequency`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.plasma_frequency`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.plasma_frequency_lite`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.lower_hybrid_frequency`, and
  `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.upper_hybrid_frequency` from
  `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` to the new module.  Related aliases
  were also migrated. (`#1439
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1439>`__)
- Migrated `~plasmapy.formulary.dimensionless.Debye_number`, and
  `~plasmapy.formulary.dimensionless.Hall_parameter` from
  `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` to
  `plasmapy.formulary.dimensionless`.  Related aliases were also
  migrated. (`#1444
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1444>`__)
- Created `plasmapy.formulary.speeds` to contain frequency related
  plasma parameters, and migrated
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.Alfven_speed`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.ion_sound_speed`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.kappa_thermal_speed`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.thermal_speed`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.thermal_speed_coefficients`, and
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.thermal_speed_lite` from
  `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` to the new module.  Related aliases
  were also migrated. (`#1448
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1448>`__)
- Created `plasmapy.formulary.misc` to contain functionality for
  miscellaneous plasma parameters, and migrated
  ``~plasmapy.formulary.misc._grab_charge``,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.misc.Bohm_diffusion`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.misc.magnetic_energy_density`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.misc.magnetic_pressure`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.misc.mass_density`, and
  `~plasmapy.formulary.misc.thermal_pressure` from
  `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` to the new module.  Related aliases
  were also migrated. (`#1453
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1453>`__)
- Created :term:`lite-functions`
  `~plasmapy.dispersion.dispersionfunction.plasma_dispersion_func_lite`
  and
  `~plasmapy.dispersion.dispersionfunction.plasma_dispersion_func_deriv_lite`
  for `~plasmapy.dispersion.dispersionfunction.plasma_dispersion_func`
  and
  `~plasmapy.dispersion.dispersionfunction.plasma_dispersion_func_deriv`
  respectively. (`#1473
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1473>`__)
- Created :term:`lite-function`
  `plasmapy.formulary.dielectric.permittivity_1D_Maxwellian_lite` for
  `plasmapy.formulary.dielectric.permittivity_1D_Maxwellian`. (`#1476
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1476>`__)
- Added the :file:`stix_.py` module to the
  `~plasmapy.dispersion.analytical` subpackage which contains the Stix
  cold-plasma dispersion solution
  :func:`~plasmapy.dispersion.analytical.stix_.stix`,
  :cite:p:`stix:1992,bellan:2012`. (`#1511
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1511>`__)
- ``Particle("Li").ionize()`` no longer results in a
  `~plasmapy.particles.exceptions.ChargeError`. Instead, ionization of
  a neutral atom is assumed. (`#1514
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1514>`__)
- Created the |ParticleListLike| typing construct and added
  :term:`particle-list-like` to the |glossary|. (`#1528
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1528>`__)
- Added a null point classifier function which determines the type of
  a given 3D magnetic null point. (`#1554

- Added support for arbitrarily shaped input arrays to the function
  `plasmapy.formulary.collisions.lengths.impact_parameter`. (`#1604
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1604>`__)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug in the ``_make_grid`` method of
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid` that would fail to smoothly
  handle invalid user input if the ``start``, ``stop``, or ``num``
  keywords were not the correct type. (`#1295
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1295>`__)
- Fixed a bug with |Particle| where ``Particle("p+") == Particle("H",
  Z=1, mass_numb=1)`` led to a |ParticleError|. (`#1366
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1366>`__)
- For ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.gyroradius``, updated the
  default keyword arguments and conditional for issuing the
  `~plasmapy.utils.exceptions.PlasmaPyFutureWarning`.  This addresses
  the incorrect behavior where a `ValueError` is raised if an array is
  passed to the deprecated keyword ``T_i``. (`#1430
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1430>`__)
- Exposed `plasmapy.formulary.misc` to the `plasmapy.formulary`
  namespace. (`#1471
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1471>`__)
- Replaced misuse of ``max_exp_bias - max_exp_bias`` with
  ``max_exp_bias - min_exp_bias`` when creating seed parameters for
  the bimaxwellian fit function inside
  :func:`~plasmapy.diagnostics.langmuir.get_electron_temperature`. (`#1487
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1487>`__)
- Corrected the improper inversion of the electron temperature for the
  non-bimaxwellian case for
  :func:`~plasmapy.diagnostics.langmuir.get_electron_temperature`.
  The electron temperature, and not the slope, is a fit parameter of
  the curve used by
  :func:`~plasmapy.diagnostics.langmuir.get_electron_temperature`, so
  there is no need for the inversion.  The returned value is now the
  electron temperature and not its reciprocal. (`#1487
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1487>`__)
- Exposed the `~plasmapy.analysis` and `~plasmapy.dispersion`
  subpackages to the `plasmapy` namespace. (`#1512
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1512>`__)
- Changed the
  :meth:`~plasmapy.analysis.fit_functions.Linear.curve_fit` method on
  `plasmapy.analysis.fit_functions.Linear` so that the arbitrary
  keyword arguments get passed to `scipy.stats.linregress`.
  Previously,
  :meth:`~plasmapy.analysis.fit_functions.Linear.curve_fit` had
  accepted arbitrary keyword arguments but did not pass them along to
  `~scipy.stats.linregress`. (`#1518
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1518>`__)
- Fixed a bug in
  :func:`~plasmapy.dispersion.numerical.hollweg_.hollweg` that did not
  allow for arguments ``theta`` and ``k`` to simultaneously be
  arrays. (`#1529 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1529>`__)
- Fixed the ``Z`` dependence in
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.fundamental_electron_collision_freq`,
  by replacing ``n_e`` with ``n_i`` while calling
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.collision_frequency`. (`#1546
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1546>`__)
- Updated the regular expression matching used by
  `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle` to parse and identify
  a :term:`particle-like` string.  This fixes the bug where a string
  with a trailing space (e.g. ``"Ar "``) was converted into a
  negatively charged ion (e.g. ``"Ar -1"``). (`#1555
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1555>`__)
- Exposed `plasmapy.formulary.radiation` and functions therein to the
  `plasmapy.formulary` namespace. (`#1572
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1572>`__)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Added a :term:`lite-function` group to the configuration value
  :confval:`automodapi_custom_groups` that introduces the
  ``__lite_funcs__`` dunder for listing the lite-functions in a module
  (akin to the ``__all__`` dunder). (`#1145
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Added a page in the |contributor guide| that describes how to add
  changelog entries. (`#1198
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1198>`__)
- Created an example notebook that lets users input plasma properties
  and get plasma parameters. (`#1229
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1229>`__)
- The file :file:`docs/_static/css/admonition_color_contrast.css` was
  added to include color customizations for Sphinx_ admonitions that
  originally came from `sphinx_rtd_theme_ext_color_contrast
  <https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/sphinx_rtd_theme_ext_color_contrast>`_.
  (`#1287 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1287>`__)
- Changed the color contrast of links and admonitions to be consistent
  with the `Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2 Level AA
  Conformance
  <https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-WCAG22-20210521/#contrast-minimum>`__
  for contrast. (`#1287
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1287>`__)
- Re-organized CSS_ files for the online documentation. The file
  :file:`docs/_static/rtd_theme_overrides.css` was re-organized, renamed
  to :file:`docs/_static/css/plasmapy.css`, and updated with comments
  to help someone unfamiliar with CSS_ to understand the file and
  syntax. (`#1287 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1287>`__)
- Put references from `plasmapy.formulary` into
  :file:`docs/bibliography.bib` in BibTeX_ format. (`#1299
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1299>`__)
- Added a discussion of test parametrization with argument unpacking
  to the |testing guide| in the |contributor guide|. (`#1316
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1316>`__)
- Adopted the `Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct version 2.1
  <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/>`__
  and updated the :ref:`Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
  <plasmapy-code-of-conduct>` page accordingly. (`#1324
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1324>`__)
- Updated deprecated meeting and calendar links in
  :file:`README.md`. (`#1327
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1327>`__)

  the documentation guide. (`#1359
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1359>`__)
- Reverted the code syntax highlighting style back to the pygments_
  default. The minimum version of pygments_ was set to ``2.11.0``
  because the default style was changed to meet accessibility
  guidelines for contrast in this release. (`#1361
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1361>`__)
- Described additional environments for building the documentation
  with make_ in the |documentation guide|. (`#1373

  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1437>`__)
- Removed the following files from :file:`docs/api_static`\ :
  ``plasmapy.particles.elements.rst``,
  ``plasmapy.particles.isotopes.rst``,
  ``plasmapy.particles.parsing.rst``, and
  ``plasmapy.particles.special_particles.rst``. These files

- Updated the instructions on how to install `plasmapy`. (`#1482
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Defined ``autodoc_typehints_format="short"`` so signature type hints
  are displayed in short form, i.e. without the leading module
  names. (`#1488 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1488>`__)
- Set minimum version of `sphinx` to ``v4.4``. (`#1488
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1488>`__)

  that broken reST_ links now emit warnings which are then treated as
  errors, fixed the new errors, removed the ``build_docs_nitpicky``
  tox_ environment, and updated the |documentation guide|
  accordingly. (`#1587
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1587>`__)
- Renamed the :file:`magnetic_statics.ipynb` notebook to
  :file:`magnetostatics.ipynb`, and made some minor edits to its text
  and plotting code. (`#1588
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1588>`__)
- Added examples sections to the documentation pages for several
  modules within `plasmapy.formulary`. (`#1590
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1590>`__)
- Re-organized the directory structure for example notebooks. (`#1590
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1590>`__)
- Alphabetized the author list in :file:`docs/about/credits.rst`, and
  added missing authors from using ``git log`` and the pull request
  history. (`#1599
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1599>`__)
- Renamed :file:`docs/development` → :file:`docs/contributing`, and
  set up redirects from the original hyperlinks to the new ones for
  the contributor guide. (`#1605
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1605>`__)
- Added |sphinx-reredirects|_ as a Sphinx_ extension to allow website
  redirects. (`#1605
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1605>`__)
- Added a :file:`robots.txt` file to the online documentation to tell
  web crawlers to ignore all but ``stable`` and ``latest``
  documentation builds when indexing for search engines. (`#1607
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1607>`__)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Streamlined `~plasmapy.utils.decorators.helpers.preserve_signature`
  such that it only binds ``__signature__`` to the wrapped function,
  i.e. it no longer touches any other attribute of the wrapped
  function. (`#1145
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Moved all tests associated with calculating the thermal speed from
  test file :file:`plasmapy/formulary/tests/test_parameters.py` to
  :file:`plasmapy/formulary/tests/test_thermal_speed.py`. (`#1145
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Applied reST_ substitutions for `plasmapy.particles` and
  |ParticleTracker| in the narrative documentation. (`#1158
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1158>`__)
- Added `csslint <https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint>`_ to the
  pre-commit_ configuration to check the formatting and style of CSS_
  files. (`#1287 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1287>`__)
- Added Python 3.10 to the `GitHub Actions`_ test suite. (`#1292
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1292>`__)
- Parametrized tests for
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.ion_sound_speed``. (`#1313
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1313>`__)
- Added cron tests of the development versions of matplotlib_ and
  SciPy_, while changing the cadence of cron tests to be run
  approximately fortnightly. (`#1333
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1333>`__)
- Applied `pytest.warns` in several tests to catch warnings that are
  being issued during execution of the test suite. (`#1345
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1345>`__)
- Split the tests running on pull requests into multiple stages. The
  various pytest_ test environments, including code coverage, now run
  conditionally given successful execution of a basic test environment
  and the linter checks. This change also prevents code coverage
  prompts from appearing twice, with incomplete information on the
  first time. (`#1350
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1350>`__)
- Added a helper function that takes an iterable and creates a `dict`
  with physical types as keys and the corresponding objects from that
  iterable as values. This change updates the minimum required version
  of Astropy_ to 4.3.1. (`#1360
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1360>`__)
- Added the module ``plasmapy.particles._factory`` which contains a
  private function that accepts arguments that can be provided to
  |Particle|, |CustomParticle|, or |ParticleList| and returns the
  appropriate instance of one of those three classes. (`#1365
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1365>`__)
- Used the extract method refactoring pattern on the initialization of
  |Particle| objects. (`#1366
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1366>`__, `#1368
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1368>`__)
- Refactored tests in `plasmapy.particles`. (`#1369
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1369>`__)
- |CustomParticle| and |DimensionlessParticle| no longer emit a
  warning when the charge and/or mass is not provided and got assigned
  a value of |nan| in the appropriate units. (`#1399
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1399>`__)
- Added unit test cases for manual entry of vector values in order to
  improve code coverage in the null point finder. (`#1427
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1427>`__)
- Consolidated and parametrized tests associated with
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.gyroradius``. (`#1430
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1430>`__)
- Within `plasmapy.particles` modules, the ``_elements``,
  ``_isotopes``, ``_parsing``, and ``_special_particles`` modules are
  now imported directly. Before this, objects within these modules
  were typically imported. (`#1440
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1440>`__)
- Renamed objects within the source code for `plasmapy.particles` to
  conform with :pep:`8` naming conventions (e.g., ``ParticleZooClass``
  → ``ParticleZoo``, ``ParticleZoo`` → ``particle_zoo``, and
  ``Particles`` → ``particles``). (`#1440
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1440>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from `Sourcery
  <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.utils`. (`#1463
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1463>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from `Sourcery
  <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.plasma`. (`#1464
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1464>`__)
- Bumped the minimum version of `h5py` to ``3.0.0``. (`#1465
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1465>`__)
- Changed the raised exception to `ImportError` (from a general
  `Exception`) when attempting to import `plasmapy` from a Python
  version below the minimum supported version. (`#1465
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1465>`__)
- Added a workflow to label pull requests based on size. (`#1467
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1467>`__, `#1492
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1492>`__)
- Separated ``plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.null_point_find`` into two
  functions named `~plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.null_point_find` and
  `plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.uniform_null_point_find`.
  `~plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.null_point_find` finds the null points
  of a vector space whose values are manually entered.
  `plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.uniform_null_point_find` finds the null
  points of a uniform vector space whose values are generated by a
  function provided by the user. (`#1477
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1477>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from `Sourcery
  <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.particles`. (`#1479
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1479>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from `Sourcery
  <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.formulary`. (`#1480
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1480>`__)
- Bumped the minimum versions of |mpmath|_ to ``1.2.1``, `numpy` to
  ``1.19.0``, `pandas` to ``1.0.0``, `pytest` to ``5.4.0``, `scipy` to
  ``1.5.0``, and |xarray|_ to ``0.15.0``. (`#1482
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Moved |h5py|_, |lmfit|_, |mpmath|_, and |numba|_ out of the
  ``extras`` requirements category and into the ``install``
  requirements category.  These packages are now installed when
  running ``pip install plasmapy``. (`#1482
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Added ``dlint``, flake8_, ``flake8-absolute-import``,
  ``flake8-rst-docstrings``, ``flake8-use-fstring``, pydocstyle_, and
  pygments_ into the ``tests`` requirements category and pre-commit_
  into the ``extras`` requirements category. These dependencies are
  not required for basic installation with pip_. (`#1482
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Updated :file:`docs/environment.yml` to use pip_ to install all
  requirements specified by :file:`requirements.txt` when creating a
  Conda_ environment. (`#1482
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Used `codespell <https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell>`__
  to fix typos. (`#1493
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1493>`__)
- Used `contextlib.suppress` to suppress exceptions, instead of
  ``try`` & ``except`` blocks. (`#1494
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1494>`__)
- Added a pre-commit_ hook that transforms relative imports to
  absolute imports, except in :file:`docs/plasmapy_sphinx`. (`#1499
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1499>`__)
- Added a test that ``import plasmapy`` does not raise an
  exception. (`#1501
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1501>`__)
- Added a GitHub Action for `codespell
  <https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell>`__, and updated the
  corresponding tox_ environment to print out contextual
  information. (`#1530
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1530>`__)
- Added :file:`plasmapy/utils/units_definitions.py` to precompute
  units which were applied to optimize functionality in
  :file:`plasmapy/formulary/distribution.py`. (`#1531
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1531>`__)
- Replaced ``except Exception`` clauses in ``formulary``,
  ``particles``, and ``utils`` with specific exception
  statements. (`#1541
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1541>`__)
- Added tests for passing array valued ``k`` and ``theta`` arguments
  to :func:`~plasmapy.dispersion.numerical.hollweg_.hollweg`, which
  was an added feature in :pr:`1529`. (`#1549
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1549>`__)
- Added `flake8-implicit-str-concat
  <https://github.com/flake8-implicit-str-concat/flake8-implicit-str-concat>`__
  and `flake8-mutable <https://github.com/ebeweber/flake8-mutable>`__
  as extensions for flake8_. (`#1557
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1557>`__)
- Added `flake8-simplify
  <https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify>`__ as an extension
  for flake8_. (`#1558
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1558>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from `Sourcery
  <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.dispersion`. (`#1562
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1562>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from `Sourcery
  <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.diagnostics`. (`#1563
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1563>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from `Sourcery
  <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.analysis`. (`#1564
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1564>`__)
- Removed an extraneous `print` statement from
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.collision_frequency` that activated
  when the colliding particles were both electrons. (`#1570
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1570>`__)
- Changed the type hints for ``z_mean`` in
  `plasmapy.formulary.collisions` functions from
  ``astropy.units.dimensionless_unscaled`` to
  `~numbers.Real`. Consequently, ``z_mean`` will no longer be
  processed by
  `~plasmapy.utils.decorators.validators.validate_quantities`. Previously,
  ``z_mean`` issued a warning when a real number was provided instead
  of a dimensionless |Quantity|. (`#1570
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1570>`__)
- Updated the version of black_ to 22.3.0 in PlasmaPy's pre-commit_
  configuration. This update included a formatting change where spaces
  around power operators were removed for sufficiently simple operands
  (e.g., ``a ** b`` → ``a**b``). (`#1582
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1582>`__)
- Renamed ``units_definitions`` to ``_units_definitions`` and
  ``units_helpers`` to ``_units_helpers`` in `plasmapy.utils` to mark
  these modules as private. (`#1587
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1587>`__)
- Updated the :file:`codemeta.json` file with metadata for the version
  ``0.8.1`` release. (`#1606
  <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1606>`__)
