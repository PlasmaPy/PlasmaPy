Feedback and Communication
==========================

Matrix chat room
----------------

The primary communication channel for PlasmaPy is our `Matrix chat
room`_. There is also a `Gitter bridge`_ to this chat room.

GitHub Discussions page
-----------------------

PlasmaPy's `GitHub Discussions page`_ is a great place to suggest ideas,
bring up discussion topics, and ask questions in threaded public
discussions.

Mailing list
------------

We also have a low traffic `mailing list`_ for occasional announcements
and infrequent discussions.

Suggestion box
--------------

We have a `suggestion box`_ if you would like to (optionally
anonymously) suggest a feature/topic for consideration. These will be
reposted as GitHub issues, as appropriate, for further discussion.

Meetings and events
-------------------

Please check `PlasmaPy meetings`_ for regularly scheduled meetings and
special events. The regularly scheduled meetings include a community
meeting to discuss code development, a project meeting to discuss
broader aspects of the PlasmaPy project like education and outreach to
the broader plasma community, and meetings of PlasmaPy working groups.
The special events include |Plasma Hack Week|.
