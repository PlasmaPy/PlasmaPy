Feedback and Communication
==========================

`Matrix chat <https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:matrix.org>`__
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The primary communication channel for PlasmaPy is our `Matrix room
<https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org>`__ (which
is bridged to `Gitter <https://gitter.im/PlasmaPy/Lobby>`__).

If you have any questions, the quickest way to get a response is to ask
on our `Matrix <https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:matrix.org>`__/ channel.

`Discourse group <https://plasmapy.discourse.group>`__
------------------------------------------------------

PlasmaPy's `Discourse group <https://plasmapy.discourse.group>`__ is a
great place to suggest ideas, bring up discussion topics, and ask
questions in threaded public discussions.

`Mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plasmapy>`__

We also have a `mailing
list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plasmapy>`__ that serves
as a less volatile discussion forum.
