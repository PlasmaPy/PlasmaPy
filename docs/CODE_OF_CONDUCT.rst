Community Code of Conduct
=========================

The PlasmaPy community strives to follow the best practices in open
source software development. New contributors are encouraged to join the
team and contribute to the codebase. We anticipate/encourage a global
participation from people with diverse backgrounds, skills, interests,
and opinions. We believe that such diversity is critical in ensuring a
growth of ideas in our community.

Our Pledge
----------

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our Standards
-------------

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

-  Using welcoming and inclusive language
-  Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-  Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-  Focusing on what is best for the community
-  Showing empathy towards other community members

We as a community pledge to abide by the following guidelines:

-  We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment-
   and bullying-free environment, regardless of age, sex, sexual
   orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance,
   body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, and level of
   experience. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist,
   racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
-  We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing
   acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we
   pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or
   acknowledged.
-  We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and
   realize that including people with a variety of opinions and
   backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular,
   discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies,
   programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be
   done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all
   participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely
   express their opinions.
-  We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying
   particular attention to those new to the community. We pledge to
   provide respectful criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in
   discussion threads resulting from code contributions.
-  We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider
   community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to
   model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement,
   both within our community and where we are criticized. We will treat
   those outside our community with the same respect as people within
   our community.
-  We pledge to work from the very beginning of this project to make
   PlasmaPy accessible to people with disabilities.
-  We pledge to help the entire community follow these guidelines, and
   to not remain silent when we see violations of them. We will take
   action when members of our community violate these guidelines.
   Members of the PlasmaPy community may contact any member of the
   Coordinating Committee to report violations. Members of the
   Coordinating Committee will treat these reports in the strictest
   confidence. The Coordinating Committee will develop formal procedures
   for how to handle reported violations.

Our Responsibilities
--------------------

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an
official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media
account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or
offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and
clarified by project maintainers.

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by contacting Nick Murphy at namurphy@cfa.harvard.edu or any
member of the Coordinating Committee. All complaints will be reviewed
and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary
and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to
maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Project team members should recuse themselves from enforcement of the
code of conduct for a given incident if they have an actual or apparent
conflict of interest.  Further details of specific enforcement policies
may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in
good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined
by other members of the project’s leadership.
