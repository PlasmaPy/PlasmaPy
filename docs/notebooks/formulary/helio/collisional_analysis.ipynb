    "The bi-modal distribution in the probability density predicted by collisional analysis can be seen in observations from WIND, this is consistent with the findings of [Kasper 2008][kasper2008] and [Tracy 2015][tracy2015]. These results strongly suggest that outside of the corona, relative ion temperatures are principally affected by Coulomb collisions and that the preferential heating of $\\alpha$-particles is largely limited to the corona.\n"
