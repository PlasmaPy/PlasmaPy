Installing Python
=================

PlasmaPy requires a version of |Python| between |minpython| and
|maxpython|. If you do not have |Python| installed already, here are the
instructions to `download Python`_ and install it. :snake:

.. tip::

   New versions of |Python| are released annually in October, and it can
   take a few months for the scientific Python ecosystem to catch up. If
   you have trouble installing `plasmapy` on the most recent |Python|
   version between October and March, then try installing it on the
   second most recent version.

.. _install-pip:

Installing PlasmaPy with pip
============================

To install the most recent release of `plasmapy` on |PyPI| with |pip| into
an existing |Python| |minpython|\ + environment on macOS or Linux, open a
terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install plasmapy

On some systems, it might be necessary to specify the |Python| version
number by using ``python3``, ``python3.8``, ``python3.9``,
``python3.10``, or ``python3.11`` instead of ``python``.

To install PlasmaPy on Windows, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   py -3.11 -m pip install plasmapy

The version of |Python| may be changed from ``3.11`` to another supported
Python |minpython|\ + release that has been installed on your computer.

For more detailed information, please refer to this tutorial on
`installing packages`_.

.. _install-uv:

Installing PlasmaPy with uv
===========================

|uv| is "an extremely fast |Python| package and project manager, written
in Rust". |uv| lets us create and switch between |Python| environments
that are isolated from each other and the system's |Python|
installation. In addition, |uv| provides a `pip drop-in interface`_ for
common |pip| commands so that |Python| packages on |PyPI| may be
installed into |uv|-managed
`virtual environments <virtual environment_>`_ without installing |pip|.

After `installing uv`_, a `virtual environment`_ with |Python| version
3.12 can be created by opening a terminal and running:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv venv --python 3.12

|uv| will automatically download |Python| and link it to
the `virtual environment`_'s directory at (by default) :file:`.venv`. The
environment can then be activated by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   source .venv/bin/activate

Then, to install `plasmapy` into the activated environment, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install plasmapy

.. _install-conda:

Installing PlasmaPy with Conda
==============================

Conda_ is a package management system and environment manager that is
commonly used in the scientific |Python| ecosystem. Similar to |uv|,
Conda_ is used to create and manage isolated virtual |Python| environments.
However, Conda_ can also be used for packages written in languages other
than |Python|.

After `installing Conda`_ or miniconda_, `plasmapy` can be installed
into an activated Conda_ environment by opening a terminal and running:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge plasmapy

Here :bash:`-c conda-forge` indicates that `plasmapy` should be installed
from the conda-forge_ channel.

To install `plasmapy` into another existing Conda_ environment, append
:samp:`-n {env_name}` to the previous command, where :samp:`{env_name}`
is replaced with the name of the environment.

To create a new environment with `plasmapy` installed in it, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n env_name -c conda-forge plasmapy

where :samp:`{env_name}` is replaced by the name of the environment.
This step may take several minutes. To activate this environment, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate env_name

To update `plasmapy` to the most recent version within a currently
activated Conda_ environment, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda update plasmapy

.. tip::

   Creating a Conda_ environment can sometimes take a few minutes. If it
   takes longer than that, try updating to the newest version of Conda_
   with ``conda update conda`` or checking out these tips for
   `improving Conda performance`_.

Installing PlasmaPy with Anaconda Navigator
===========================================

.. note::

   This section contains instructions on how to install PlasmaPy with
   `Anaconda Navigator`_ at the time of writing. For the most up-to-date
   information, please go to the official documentation on `installing
   Anaconda Navigator`_ and `getting started with Anaconda Navigator`_.

`Anaconda Navigator`_ is a graphical user interface (GUI) for Conda_
that can be used to install Python packages. It is installed
automatically with newer versions of Conda_. If you are using Miniconda_
or a different Conda_ environment, you can install it with
``conda install anaconda-navigator``. After that it can be opened by
entering ``anaconda-navigator`` in the terminal.

First, go to the :guilabel:`Environments` tab and select
:guilabel:`Channels`. If ``conda-forge`` is not listed, then go to
:guilabel:`Add`, enter ``https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge``, and
click on :guilabel:`Update channels` and then :guilabel:`Update index`.

.. Is conda-forge now being added by default?
.. Is clicking on `Update index` actually necessary?

Next, while on the :guilabel:`Environments` tab, select the environment
that you would like to install `plasmapy` in. The default is generally
``base (root)``. Optionally, you may select :guilabel:`Create` to start
a new environment. In the search bar, enter ``plasmapy``. Click on the
checkbox next to ``plasmapy``, and select :guilabel:`Apply` to begin the
installation process. It may take several minutes for Anaconda Navigator
to solve package specifications.

To test the installation, click on the :guilabel:`▶` icon that should be
present next to the activated environment, and select
:guilabel:`Open terminal`. Enter ``python`` in the terminal, and then
:py:`import plasmapy` to make sure it works.

Installing PlasmaPy from source code
====================================

Obtaining official releases
---------------------------

A ZIP_ file containing the source code for official releases of
`plasmapy` can be obtained `from PyPI`_ or `from Zenodo`_.

Alternatively, official releases since 0.7.0 can be downloaded from the
releases_ page on |PlasmaPy's GitHub repository|.

Obtaining source code from GitHub
---------------------------------

If you have |git| installed on your computer, you may clone
|PlasmaPy's GitHub repository| and access the source code from the most
recent development version by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy.git

The repository will be cloned inside a new subdirectory called
:file:`PlasmaPy`.

If you do not have |git| installed on your computer, then you may
download the most recent source code from |PlasmaPy's GitHub repository|
by going to :guilabel:`Code` and selecting :guilabel:`Download ZIP`.
`Unzipping <https://www.wikihow.com/Unzip-a-File>`__ the file will
create a subdirectory called :file:`PlasmaPy` that contains the source
code.

Building and installing
-----------------------

To install the downloaded version of `plasmapy`, enter the
:file:`PlasmaPy` directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install .

If you expect to occasionally edit the source code, instead run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e ".[tests,docs]"

The ``-e`` flag makes the installation editable and ``[tests,docs]``
specifies that all of the additional dependencies used while testing the
package should also be installed.

.. note::

   If you noticed any places where the installation instructions could
   be improved or have become out of date, please `create an issue`_ on
   |PlasmaPy's GitHub repository|. It would really help!

.. tip::

   The |contributor guide| has instructions on how to fork a repository
   and create branches so that you may make contributions via pull
   requests.
