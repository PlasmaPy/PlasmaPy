Thank you for your interest in contributing to PlasmaPy! ✨ The future of
the project depends on people like you, so we deeply appreciate it! 🌱

This guide describes the fundamentals of contributing to PlasmaPy. If
you are a first-time contributor, please follow the steps for
:ref:`getting ready to contribute <Getting Ready to Contribute>` before
proceeding to the :ref:`code contribution workflow <workflow>`. The
contributions are made to |PlasmaPy's GitHub repository|.

New functions and classes added to PlasmaPy must have documentation and
tests. The |documentation guide| contains sections on |reStructuredText|
and :ref:`writing documentation <writing-documentation>`. The
|testing guide| has sections on :ref:`writing tests <writing-tests>`
and :ref:`testing best practices <testing-best-practices>`. Unless it is
minor, it will also be necessary to :ref:`add a changelog entry
<add-changelog>`.

The PlasmaPy community abides by the :ref:`Contributor Covenant Code of
Conduct <plasmapy-code-of-conduct>`.
