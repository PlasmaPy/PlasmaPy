Thank you for your interest in contributing to PlasmaPy! ✨ The future of
the project depends on people like you, so we deeply appreciate it! 🌱

If you are becoming a first-time contributor, we recommend starting with:

* :ref:`Getting ready to contribute <Getting Ready to Contribute>`, and then
* The :ref:`code contribution workflow <workflow>`.

The contributions are made to |PlasmaPy's GitHub repository|.

The |coding guide| provides tips, best practices, and guidelines for
writing clean scientific code in PlasmaPy. The |testing guide| explains how to write and run tests using the `pytest`
framework.
The |documentation guide| covers how to write docstrings and narrative


New functions and classes added to PlasmaPy must have documentation and
tests. The |documentation guide| contains sections on |reStructuredText|
and :ref:`writing documentation <writing-documentation>`. The
|testing guide| has sections on :ref:`writing tests <writing-tests>`
and :ref:`testing best practices <testing-best-practices>`. Unless it is
minor, it will also be necessary to :ref:`add a changelog entry
<add-changelog>`.

The PlasmaPy community abides by the :ref:`Contributor Covenant Code of
Conduct <plasmapy-code-of-conduct>`.
