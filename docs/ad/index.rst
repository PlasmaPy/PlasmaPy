Analysis & Diagnostic Toolkits
==============================

Analyses and diagnostics go hand-in-hand, but have subtle differences.  Thus,
PlasmaPy gives each their own sub-packages, `plasmapy.analysis` and
`plasmapy.diagnostics` respectively.


Think of the `plasmapy.analysis` as your toolbox.  It has all the tools
(functionality) you need to analyze your data.  Functionality is built around
`numpy arrays <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.html>`_ and each
function has a well-defined, focused task.  For example, :func:`numpy.fft.fft`
does one specific task: compute the one-dimensional discrete Fourier Transform.
Similarly, :func:`plasmapy.analysis.swept_langmuir.find_floating_potential` only
finds the floating potential for a given Langmuir trace.  It does not have
smoothing.  It does not do any filtering.  It does not do any signal
conditioning.  Its sole task is to find the floating potential of a single
Langmuir trace.

Diagnostics have a much broader scope and leverage the tools
defined in `plasmapy.analysis` to give a more integrated user experience when
analyzing data.  Diagnostics try to enhance the analysis workflow by focusing
on some of following key areas...

#. A more human-friendly way of managing data by building an interface around
   |xarray|_ arrays and datasets via custom diagnostic accessors.

   - |xarray|_ provides labeled multi-dimensional arrays and datasets.
   - Diagnostics self-manage the computed analysis data within a |xarray|_
     dataset while maintaining the computed data's relation to the original
     data.

#. Quick viewing of analyzed data with default plotting routines.
#. Fully defining the physical parameters of a diagnostic with purposely
   designed ``Probe`` classes that are integrated into the analysis workflow.
#. Adding graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to the analysis workflow via notebook
   widgets.
