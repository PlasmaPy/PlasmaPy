# The error codes for pydocstyle include:
#
#  *D107: Missing docstring in __init__
#   D202: No blank lines allowed after function docstring
#  *D203: 1 blank line required before class docstring
#   D205: 1 blank line required between summary line and description
#  *D212: Multi-line docstring summary should start at the first line
#   D213: Multi-line docstring summary should start at the second line
#   D302: Use u""" for Unicode docstrings
#   D400: First line should end with a period
#  *D402: First line should not be the function's "signature"
#   D405: Section name should be properly capitalized
#   D412: No blank lines allowed between a section header and its content
#  *D413: Missing blank line after last section
#
# The error codes marked with an asterisk are ignored by default when
# using the numpy convention. The full set of error codes are available at:
#
#    http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/latest/error_codes.html
#
# D302 is unnecessary as we are using Python 3.6+. Ignoring D202 allows blank
# lines to be put on either side of code "paragraphs" at the beginning of a
# function. D205 and D400 are ignored to allow the "one-liner" to exceed one
# line, which is sometimes necessary for even concise descriptions of plasma
# physics functions and classes.
