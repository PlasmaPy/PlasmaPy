PlasmaPy is an open source community developed Python 3.6+ package for
plasma physics in the early stages of development.  PlasmaPy intends to
be for plasmas what [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) is for
astronomy - a collection of functionality commonly used and shared
between plasma physicists and researchers globally, running within and
leveraging the open source scientific Python ecosystem.  The goals of
this project are more thoroughly described in our [vision
statement](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/about/vision_statement.html)
and [this recent reference](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1238132).
We are in the process of writing [online
documentation](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/).

We created a guide on [contributing to PlasmaPy](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/CONTRIBUTING.html)
and have a [Code of Conduct](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html).
New contributors are very welcome!

# Feedback and communication

## [Matrix chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org)

If you have any questions, the quickest way to get a response is to ask
on our
[Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org)/[Gitter](https://gitter.im/PlasmaPy/Lobby)
channel. 

## [Discourse room](https://plasmapy.discourse.group/)

We have recently created a [PlasmaPy Discourse 
group](https://plasmapy.discourse.group/) in order to allow threaded 
public discussions on a variety of topics.  This group is a great 
place to suggest ideas, bring up discussion topics, and ask questions.

## [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plasmapy)

We also have a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plasmapy)
that serves as a less volatile discussion forum.

## [Suggestion box](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdT3O5iHZrLJRuavFyzoR23PGy0Prfzx2SQOcwJGWtvHyT2lw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

We have 
[a suggestion box](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdT3O5iHZrLJRuavFyzoR23PGy0Prfzx2SQOcwJGWtvHyT2lw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
if you would like to (optionally anonymously) suggest
a feature/topic for consideration. These will be reposted on the mailing list
or directly in GitHub issues, as appropriate, for further discussion.

## [Weekly](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bzVsb3ZkcW0zaWxsam00ZTlrMDd2cmw5bWdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) [community meetings](https://jitsi.riot.im/plasmapy)

We have weekly community meetings in the
[PlasmaPy room on Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/plasmapy).
The schedule of our community meetings is on our [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bzVsb3ZkcW0zaWxsam00ZTlrMDd2cmw5bWdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ), and you may access the [minutes and 
agendas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByPG8nie6fTPV1FQUEkzMTgtRTg?usp=sharing).
Any last minute changes will be discussed on 
[Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org).
As of April 2020, our meetings are on Tuesdays at
[18:00 UTC](http://time.unitarium.com/utc/6pm).
Come discuss plasma software with us!

# Installation

You can get PlasmaPy from pip via `pip install plasmapy`. To contribute
to the package, check out [our instructions on installing PlasmaPy from
source](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/install.html#building-and-installing-from-source-code).

You can also get PlasmaPy from `conda` via `conda install -c conda-forge plasmapy`.

Like most scientific Python packages, PlasmaPy probably runs better on the
[Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads).

PlasmaPy requires Python 3.6+ and is [not compatible with
Python 2](https://pythonclock.org/).
