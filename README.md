[PlasmaPy] is an open source, community-developed [Python] package for
plasma research and education. PlasmaPy intends to be for plasma science
what [Astropy] is for astronomy — a collection of functionality commonly
needed by plasma scientists and researchers globally, running within and
leveraging the open source scientific Python ecosystem. The goals of
PlasmaPy are more thoroughly described in [this video]. Many of our
recent presentations are available from the
[PlasmaPy Community on Zenodo].

## Documentation

Please check out our online [**documentation**] to learn more about
PlasmaPy's capabilities.

If you would like an idea of what PlasmaPy can do, go to our
[example gallery] of Jupyter notebooks. To learn more about how to
contribute, check out PlasmaPy's [contributor guide].

## Installing PlasmaPy

PlasmaPy's online documentation has detailed instructions on how to
[**install PlasmaPy**].

To install PlasmaPy on macOS or Linux, open a terminal and run:

```Shell
python -m pip install plasmapy
```

On some systems, it might be necessary to specify the Python version
number, for example by using `python3` or `python3.13` instead of
`python`.

To install PlasmaPy in Windows via PowerShell, run:

```Shell
py -3.13 -m pip install plasmapy
```

The `3.13` may be replaced by any version of Python that is installed
and supported by PlasmaPy.

## Citing PlasmaPy

If you use PlasmaPy for research resulting in a publication, please
[cite PlasmaPy]. It really helps support the project! Citing software
used in research provides credit to its authors, promotes open science &
scientific reproducibility, and helps open source projects demonstrate
to funding agencies that continued development should be supported.

Please check out the [PlasmaPy community on Zenodo] for prior releases
of PlasmaPy and other resources.

## Requesting features

Please [submit a feature request] in our [GitHub repository] if you have
an idea for new or improved functionality. PlasmaPy is community-driven,
and feature requests really help guide the future of the project.

## Submitting bug reports

Please [submit a bug report] on PlasmaPy's GitHub repository if you
notice any problems. We really appreciate it!

## Contributing

If you are interested in contributing, please check out our
[contributor guide] and [code of conduct]. There are a number of
[good first issues] in our GitHub repository. New contributors are very
welcome!

## Events

PlasmaPy has several [meetings] that are on our [calendar]. Events are
usually held on PlasmaPy's [Zoom] room. The most up-to-date information
about these meetings is on the [meetings] page of PlasmaPy's website.

### Community meetings

PlasmaPy's weekly [community meetings] are a place to talk about code
development, event planning, and other community happenings. If you have
an idea for a new feature or would like to become involved in the
PlasmaPy project, community meetings are a great place to start. As of
May 2025, our community meetings are on most Thursdays at 2 pm ET.

## Community

## Contact information

Please feel free to reach out to us at [team@plasmapy.org] or stop by
one of our [community meetings] with any ideas, questions, and/or puns
about computational magnetohydrodynamics.

Please use these links to [submit a feature request] and to
[submit a bug report] on PlasmaPy's GitHub repository.

### GitHub discussions

We're trying out [GitHub discussions] as a place to suggest ideas, bring
up discussion topics, and ask questions.

### Matrix chat

If you have any questions, the quickest way to get a response is to ask
on our [Matrix]/[Gitter] channel. Both of these are the same chat
channel; Gitter uses a bridge to link the two.

### Mailing list

Subscribe to PlasmaPy's low-volume [mailing list] to receive occasional
newsletters and announcements.
