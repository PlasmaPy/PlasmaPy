PlasmaPy v0.9.0 (2022-11-11)
============================

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- Removed the ``none_shall_pass`` parameter from
  |particle_input|. Instead, `typing.Optional` should be used to create
  the annotation (e.g., ``Optional[ParticleLike]``). (:pr:`1057`)
- Renamed the first |parameter| of |particle_input| from
  ``wrapped_function`` to ``wrapped``. (:pr:`1057`)
- Refactored the return pattern
  of
  `~plasmapy.analysis.swept_langmuir.floating_potential.find_floating_potential`
  to follow the ``(vf, extras)`` pattern, where ``vf`` is the computed
  floating potential and ``extras`` is an instance of
  `~plasmapy.analysis.swept_langmuir.floating_potential.VFExtras`
  containing extra parameters from the computation. (:pr:`1565`)
- Moved ``plasmapy.particles.particle_collections.ionic_levels`` to
  `plasmapy.particles.atomic.ionic_levels`. (:pr:`1697`)
- Deprecated
  ``plasmapy.formulary.collisions.fundamental_electron_collision_freq``.
  The
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.MaxwellianCollisionFrequencies.Maxwellian_avg_ei_collision_freq`
  attribute of
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.MaxwellianCollisionFrequencies`
  should be used instead. (:pr:`1703`)
- Deprecated ``plasmapy.formulary.collisions.fundamental_ion_collision_freq``.
  The
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.MaxwellianCollisionFrequencies.Maxwellian_avg_ii_collision_freq`
  attribute of
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.MaxwellianCollisionFrequencies`
  should be used instead. (:pr:`1703`)
- The parameters ``Z`` and ``mass_numb`` are now |keyword-only| for
  `~plasmapy.particles.symbols.ionic_symbol` and
  `~plasmapy.particles.symbols.particle_symbol`. (:pr:`1718`)
- Moved the ``valid_categories`` attribute of
  `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.AbstractPhysicalParticle.is_category`
  to `plasmapy.particles.particle_class.valid_categories`. (:pr:`1720`)
- Changed the behavior of |IonicLevel|, |IonizationState|, and
  |IonizationStateCollection| so that an equality comparison with an
  `object` of a different type returns `False` instead of raising a
  `TypeError`. (:pr:`1721`)
- When the argument provided to
  `~plasmapy.formulary.magnetostatics.GeneralWire` is not callable, a
  `TypeError` will be raised instead of a `ValueError`. (:pr:`1782`)
- In `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density` and
  `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density_model`, a `TypeError` is
  now raised when ``ions`` is an unsupported type. (:pr:`1782`)
- In `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid`, a `TypeError` is now raised
  instead of a `ValueError` when ``start`` or ``stop`` are not of the
  appropriate type. (:pr:`1783`)


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- The capability of |particle_input| to process arguments annotated with
  |Particle| or ``(Particle, Particle)`` is now deprecated and will be
  removed in a future release. Use |ParticleLike| as an annotation
  instead. (:pr:`1057`)
- The ``integer_charges`` attribute of |IonizationState| has been
  removed after being deprecated in ``v0.7.0``. Use
  `~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonizationState.charge_numbers`
  instead. (:pr:`1633`)
- The ``integer_charge`` attributes of |Particle| and |IonicLevel| have
  been removed after being deprecated in ``v0.7.0``. Use the
  ``charge_number`` attribute instead. (:pr:`1633`)
- The ``plasmapy.particles.atomic.integer_charge`` function has been
  removed after being deprecated in ``v0.7.0``. Use
  `~plasmapy.particles.atomic.charge_number` instead. (:pr:`1633`)
- Deprecated `plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.collision_frequency`
  in favor of collision frequency classes in `plasmapy.formulary.collisions`.
  See also :pr:`1703`. (:pr:`1676`)


Features
--------

- Expanded the functionality of the |particle_input| decorator to convert
  |particle-like| and |particle-list-like| arguments into |Particle|,
  |CustomParticle|, and |ParticleList| objects. This change is part of an
  ongoing effort to improve compatibility of functions in subpackages like
  `plasmapy.particles` and `plasmapy.formulary` with |CustomParticle| and
  |ParticleList| objects. (:pr:`1057`)
- Added the
  `~plasmapy.analysis.swept_langmuir.ion_saturation_current.find_ion_saturation_current`
  function to the `~plasmapy.analysis.swept_langmuir` module.  The function
  fits the tail of a swept Langmuir probe trace and returns the linear
  fit corresponding to the ion-saturation current. (:pr:`1469`)
- Created `plasmapy.utils.data` to contain functionality for downloading data
  from
  `PlasmaPy's data repository`_. This module contains a new prototype function
  `plasmapy.utils.data.downloader.get_file` which downloads a file from the
  repository. (:pr:`1486`)
- Added the |RelativisticBody| class to facilitate calculation of the
  relativistic properties of a body in motion. (:pr:`1540`)
- Added ``inplace`` as an optional argument to
  `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_integrators.boris_push`. (:pr:`1556`)

  critical density of a plasma for a given frequency of radiation. (:pr:`1664`)
- Added the ``plasmapy.formulary.collisions.CollisionFrequencies`` class.
  This class can be used to calculate collision frequencies for two
  interacting species in a plasma. Superseded by :pr:`1703`. (:pr:`1676`)
- Reimplemented `~plasmapy.formulary.quantum.chemical_potential`. (:pr:`1678`)
- Allowed `~plasmapy.formulary.relativity.Lorentz_factor` to accept and
  return |nan| values. (:pr:`1681`)
- Added a test for `~plasmapy.formulary.dimensionless.Hall_parameter` in
  :file:`plasmapy/formulary/test/test_dimensionless.py`\ . (:pr:`1689`)
- Replaced usage of `os.path` with the more modern `pathlib`. (:pr:`1690`)
- Replaced ``pkg_resources`` with the more modern `importlib.metadata`.
  (:pr:`1692`)
- Added the `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.CustomParticle.categories`
  attribute to |CustomParticle|, and added the ``"custom"`` particle
  category. (:pr:`1700`)
- Moved the ``is_category`` method of |Particle| to
  `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.AbstractPhysicalParticle`. This
  method is now inherited by both |Particle| and |CustomParticle|. (:pr:`1700`)
- Added
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.MaxwellianCollisionFrequencies`
  for
  calculating relevant collision frequencies for Maxwellian populations.
  (:pr:`1703`)
- Refactored `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions`.  The file
  :file:`collisions.py` was converted into a subpackage (directory) and
  it's contents was split into appropriately categorized and named
  sub-modules (files). (:pr:`1769`)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Modified tests in the class ``TestSyntheticRadiograph`` to try to fix an
  intermittent failure of ``test_optical_density_histogram``. (:pr:`1685`)

  (:pr:`1500`)
- Restricted the required version of
  `sphinx-gallery <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html>`__
  to ``< 0.11.0``, since
  ``sphinx-gallery`` changed their thumbnail containers to flex containers.

Plasmapy 0.8.1 (2022-07-05)
===========================

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- In `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density`, the arguments ``Te`` and ``Ti`` have been renamed ``T_e`` and ``T_i``
  and are now required :term:`keyword-only` arguments. (`#974 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/974>`__)
- Moved the ``grid_resolution`` attribute from `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid`
  to `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid` and `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.NonUniformCartesianGrid`
  separately. This fixes a potential future bug, because this attribute is only valid as written
  when all axes share the same units. (`#1295 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1295>`__)
- Changed the behavior of the ``__repr__`` method of |CustomParticle| to
  display the symbol as well if it was provided. (`#1397 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1397>`__)
- Removed a block of code that printed out special particle properties
  when ``plasmapy.particles.special_particles`` (renamed to
  ``plasmapy.particles._special_particles``) was executed. (`#1440 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1440>`__)
- Renamed ``plasmapy.particles.elements`` to ``plasmapy.particles._elements``,
  ``plasmapy.particles.isotopes`` to ``plasmapy.particles._isotopes``,
  ``plasmapy.particles.parsing`` to ``plasmapy.particles._parsing``, and
  ``plasmapy.particles.special_particles`` to
  ``plasmapy.particles._special_particles``. Consequently, these modules
  are no longer part of PlasmaPy's public API. Most of these modules did
  not contain any public objects, except for
  ``plasmapy.particles.special_particles.ParticleZoo`` which was renamed
  to ``plasmapy.particles._special_particles.particle_zoo`` and removed
  from the public API. (`#1440 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1440>`__)
- The parameters ``Z`` and ``mass_numb`` to |Particle| are now
  :term:`keyword-only`. (`#1456 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1456>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Officially deprecated `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` and scheduled its
  permanent removal for the ``v0.9.0`` release. (`#1453 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1453>`__)
- Dropped support for Python 3.7 in accordance with the deprecation policy
  laid out in `NumPy Enhancement Proposal 29
  <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`__. (`#1465 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1465>`__)
- The ``[all]`` option when using pip_ to install `plasmapy` is now
  deprecated and may be removed in a future release. Packages that were
  previously optional (|h5py|_, |lmfit|, |mpmath|_, and |numba|_) are now
  installed by default when running ``pip install plasmapy``. To install
  all packages required for code development of PlasmaPy, instead run
  ``pip install plasmapy[developer]``. (`#1482 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Removed ``plasmapy.optional_deps``. (`#1482 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)


Features
--------

- `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density` and `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density_model`
  now support `~plasmapy.particles.particle_collections` objects as input to the ``ions`` keywords. (`#974 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/974>`__)
- Created a :term:`lite-function` for `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density`, `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density_lite`. (`#974 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/974>`__)
- Added a fitting function for 1D spectra, `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density_model`, to the Thomson scattering diagnostic module. (`#974 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/974>`__)
- Created function ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_coefficients``
  to support ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_lite`` usage by
  calculating the various thermal speed coefficients.
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_coefficients`` is also bound
  to ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed`` as the ``coefficients``
  attribute. (`#1145 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Created decorator `~plasmapy.utils.decorators.lite_func.bind_lite_func`
  for handling the binding of :term:`lite-functions` and any supporting
  functions to a parent function. (`#1145 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Introduced the concept of :term:`lite-functions`, by creating the lite-function
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_lite``, which is a simplified
  and Numba_ jitted version of ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed``.
  These functions are intended for computational use and as such have no
  validation of input or output values.
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_lite`` is also bound to
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed`` as the ``lite`` attribute. (`#1145 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Added the :file:`hollweg_.py` module to the `~plasmapy.dispersion.numerical`
  subpackage to numerically solve the dispersion relation using Hollweg's method
  :cite:p:`hollweg:1999,bellan:2012`. (`#1189 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1189>`__)
- Implemented non-breaking speed improvements on the methods
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid.nearest_neighbor_interpolator`
  and `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid.volume_averaged_interpolator`
  for `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid`. The new interpolators now
  require that the grid axes be sorted, which is always true for uniform
  grids. Added a new test to ensure this stays true. (`#1295 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1295>`__)
- Refactored the interpolator methods on objects defined in `~plasmapy.plasma.grids`.
  All interpolators are now defined in the subclasses of `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid`.
  Calling the interpolator methods on `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid`
  raises a `NotImplementedError` exception. (`#1295 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1295>`__)
- Created :term:`lite-function` ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.plasma_frequency_lite``. (`#1308 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1308>`__)
- Added the `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.molecule` function to build
  |CustomParticle| objects from a `str` representing a molecule symbol. (`#1309 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1309>`__)
- Added the `~plasmapy.particles.particle_collections.ParticleList.is_category`
  method for |ParticleList| objects.  This method is analogous to the
  `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle.is_category` method for
  |Particle| objects. (`#1378 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1378>`__)
- Created the prototype analysis tool `plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint` for finding the
  null points in a vector space using the trilinear interpolation method of
  :cite:t:`haynes:2007`. (`#1383 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1383>`__)
- Created `plasmapy.formulary.lengths` to contain length related plasma
  parameters, and migrated `~plasmapy.formulary.lengths.Debye_length`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.lengths.gyroradius`, and
  `~plasmapy.formulary.lengths.inertial_length` from
  `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` to the new module.  Related aliases were
  also migrated. (`#1434 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1434>`__)
- Created `plasmapy.formulary.frequencies` to contain frequency related
  plasma parameters, and migrated
  `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.gyrofrequency`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.plasma_frequency`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.plasma_frequency_lite`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.lower_hybrid_frequency`, and
  `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.upper_hybrid_frequency` from
  `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` to the new module.  Related aliases were
  also migrated. (`#1439 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1439>`__)
- Migrated
  `~plasmapy.formulary.dimensionless.Debye_number`, and
  `~plasmapy.formulary.dimensionless.Hall_parameter` from
  `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` to `plasmapy.formulary.dimensionless`.
  Related aliases were also migrated. (`#1444 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1444>`__)
- Created `plasmapy.formulary.speeds` to contain frequency related
  plasma parameters, and migrated
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.Alfven_speed`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.ion_sound_speed`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.kappa_thermal_speed`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.thermal_speed`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.thermal_speed_coefficients`, and
  `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.thermal_speed_lite` from
  `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` to the new module.  Related aliases were
  also migrated. (`#1448 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1448>`__)
- Created `plasmapy.formulary.misc` to contain functionality for
  miscellaneous plasma parameters, and migrated
  ``~plasmapy.formulary.misc._grab_charge``,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.misc.Bohm_diffusion`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.misc.magnetic_energy_density`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.misc.magnetic_pressure`,
  `~plasmapy.formulary.misc.mass_density`, and
  `~plasmapy.formulary.misc.thermal_pressure` from
  `plasmapy.formulary.parameters` to the new module.  Related aliases were
  also migrated. (`#1453 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1453>`__)
- Created :term:`lite-functions`
  `~plasmapy.dispersion.dispersionfunction.plasma_dispersion_func_lite` and
  `~plasmapy.dispersion.dispersionfunction.plasma_dispersion_func_deriv_lite`
  for `~plasmapy.dispersion.dispersionfunction.plasma_dispersion_func`
  and `~plasmapy.dispersion.dispersionfunction.plasma_dispersion_func_deriv`
  respectively. (`#1473 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1473>`__)
- Created :term:`lite-function`
  `plasmapy.formulary.dielectric.permittivity_1D_Maxwellian_lite` for
  `plasmapy.formulary.dielectric.permittivity_1D_Maxwellian`. (`#1476 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1476>`__)
- Added the :file:`stix_.py` module to the `~plasmapy.dispersion.analytical`
  subpackage which contains the Stix cold-plasma dispersion solution
  :func:`~plasmapy.dispersion.analytical.stix_.stix`,
  :cite:p:`stix:1992,bellan:2012`. (`#1511 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1511>`__)
- ``Particle("Li").ionize()`` no longer results in a `~plasmapy.particles.exceptions.ChargeError`. Instead, ionization of a neutral atom is assumed. (`#1514 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1514>`__)
- Created the |ParticleListLike| typing construct and added
  :term:`particle-list-like` to the |glossary|. (`#1528 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1528>`__)
- Added a null point classifier function which determines the
  type of a given 3D magnetic null point. (`#1554 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1554>`__)
- Added support for arbitrarily shaped input arrays to the function `plasmapy.formulary.collisions.lengths.impact_parameter`. (`#1604 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1604>`__)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug in the ``_make_grid`` method of `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid`
  that would fail to smoothly handle invalid user input if the ``start``,
  ``stop``, or ``num`` keywords were not the correct type. (`#1295 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1295>`__)
- Fixed a bug with |Particle| where ``Particle("p+") == Particle("H", Z=1,
  mass_numb=1)`` led to a |ParticleError|. (`#1366 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1366>`__)
- For ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.gyroradius``, updated the default
  keyword arguments and conditional for issuing the
  `~plasmapy.utils.exceptions.PlasmaPyFutureWarning`.  This addresses the
  incorrect behavior where a `ValueError` is raised if an array is passed
  to the deprecated keyword ``T_i``. (`#1430 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1430>`__)
- Exposed `plasmapy.formulary.misc` to the `plasmapy.formulary` namespace. (`#1471 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1471>`__)
- Replaced misuse of ``max_exp_bias - max_exp_bias`` with ``max_exp_bias - min_exp_bias``
  when creating seed parameters for the bimaxwellian fit function inside
  :func:`~plasmapy.diagnostics.langmuir.get_electron_temperature`. (`#1487 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1487>`__)
- Corrected the improper inversion of the electron temperature for the
  non-bimaxwellian case for
  :func:`~plasmapy.diagnostics.langmuir.get_electron_temperature`.
  The electron temperature, and not the slope, is a fit parameter of the
  curve used by
  :func:`~plasmapy.diagnostics.langmuir.get_electron_temperature`,
  so there is no need for the inversion.  The returned value is now the
  electron temperature and not its reciprocal. (`#1487 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1487>`__)
- Exposed the `~plasmapy.analysis` and `~plasmapy.dispersion` subpackages
  to the `plasmapy` namespace. (`#1512 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1512>`__)
- Changed the :meth:`~plasmapy.analysis.fit_functions.Linear.curve_fit`
  method on `plasmapy.analysis.fit_functions.Linear` so that the
  arbitrary keyword arguments get passed to `scipy.stats.linregress`.
  Previously, :meth:`~plasmapy.analysis.fit_functions.Linear.curve_fit`
  had accepted arbitrary keyword arguments but did not pass them along to
  `~scipy.stats.linregress`. (`#1518 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1518>`__)
- Fixed a bug in :func:`~plasmapy.dispersion.numerical.hollweg_.hollweg`
  that did not allow for arguments ``theta`` and ``k`` to simultaneously
  be arrays. (`#1529 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1529>`__)
- Fixed the ``Z`` dependence in
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.fundamental_electron_collision_freq`,
  by replacing ``n_e`` with ``n_i`` while calling
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.collision_frequency`. (`#1546 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1546>`__)
- Updated the regular expression matching used by
  `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle` to parse and identify a
  :term:`particle-like` string.  This fixes the bug where a string with
  a trailing space (e.g. ``"Ar "``) was converted into a negatively charged
  ion (e.g. ``"Ar -1"``). (`#1555 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1555>`__)
- Exposed `plasmapy.formulary.radiation` and functions therein to the
  `plasmapy.formulary` namespace. (`#1572 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1572>`__)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Added a :term:`lite-function` group to the configuration value
  :confval:`automodapi_custom_groups` that introduces the
  ``__lite_funcs__`` dunder for listing the lite-functions in a module
  (akin to the ``__all__`` dunder). (`#1145 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Added a page in the |contributor guide| that describes how to add
  changelog entries. (`#1198 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1198>`__)

- Changed the color contrast of links and admonitions to be consistent
  with the `Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2 Level AA Conformance
  <https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-WCAG22-20210521/#contrast-minimum>`__
  for contrast. (`#1287 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1287>`__)
- Re-organized CSS_ files for the online documentation. The file
  :file:`docs/_static/rtd_theme_overrides.css` was re-organized,
  renamed to :file:`docs/_static/css/plasmapy.css`, and updated with
  comments to help someone unfamiliar with CSS_ to understand the file and
  syntax. (`#1287 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1287>`__)

  default. The minimum version of pygments_ was set to ``2.11.0`` because
  the default style was changed to meet accessibility guidelines for
  contrast in this release. (`#1361 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1361>`__)
- Described additional environments for building the documentation with make_
  in the |documentation guide|. (`#1373 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1373>`__)

- Removed the following files from :file:`docs/api_static`\ :
  ``plasmapy.particles.elements.rst``,
  ``plasmapy.particles.isotopes.rst``,
  ``plasmapy.particles.parsing.rst``, and
  ``plasmapy.particles.special_particles.rst``. These files corresponded
  to modules that were renamed with a leading underscore to indicate that
  they are no longer part of the public API. (`#1440 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1440>`__)
- Updated the docstring for `plasmapy.particles.particle_class.molecule`. (`#1455 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1455>`__)
- Hid the documentation page that contained the subpackage stability
  matrix. (`#1466 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1466>`__)

- Removed the section on package requirements from the instructions on how
  to install `plasmapy`. (`#1482 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Updated the instructions on how to install `plasmapy`. (`#1482 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Defined ``autodoc_typehints_format="short"`` so signature type hints
  are displayed in short form, i.e. without the leading module names. (`#1488 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1488>`__)
- Set minimum version of `sphinx` to ``v4.4``. (`#1488 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1488>`__)

  links to external domains which have a common base URL. (`#1532 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1532>`__)
- Added the |sphinx-notfound-page|_ extension to Sphinx_ so that the
  documentation now has a :wikipedia:`404 <HTTP_404>` page in the same
  style as the rest of the documentation. (`#1532 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1532>`__)
- Added a notebook on using `~plasmapy.formulary.dimensionless.beta`
  from the `plasmapy.formulary` module to calculate plasma β in
  different parts of the solar atmosphere. (`#1552 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1552>`__)

  environment, and updated the |documentation guide| accordingly. (`#1587 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1587>`__)
- Renamed the :file:`magnetic_statics.ipynb` notebook to
  :file:`magnetostatics.ipynb`, and made some minor edits to its text
  and plotting code. (`#1588 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1588>`__)

  crawlers to ignore all but ``stable`` and ``latest`` documentation
  builds when indexing for search engines. (`#1607 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1607>`__)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Streamlined `~plasmapy.utils.decorators.helpers.preserve_signature` such that it only
  binds ``__signature__`` to the wrapped function, i.e. it no longer touches
  any other attribute of the wrapped function. (`#1145 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Moved all tests associated with calculating the thermal speed from test
  file :file:`plasmapy/formulary/tests/test_parameters.py` to
  :file:`plasmapy/formulary/tests/test_thermal_speed.py`. (`#1145 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1145>`__)
- Applied reST_ substitutions for `plasmapy.particles` and
  |ParticleTracker| in the narrative documentation. (`#1158 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1158>`__)
- Added `csslint <https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint>`_ to the
  pre-commit_ configuration to check the formatting and style of CSS_
  files. (`#1287 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1287>`__)
- Added Python 3.10 to the `GitHub Actions`_ test suite. (`#1292 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1292>`__)
- Parametrized tests for ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.ion_sound_speed``. (`#1313 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1313>`__)
- Added cron tests of the development versions of matplotlib_ and SciPy_,
  while changing the cadence of cron tests to be run approximately
  fortnightly. (`#1333 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1333>`__)
- Applied `pytest.warns` in several tests to catch warnings that are being
  issued during execution of the test suite. (`#1345 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1345>`__)
- Split the tests running on pull requests into multiple stages. The
  various pytest_ test environments, including code coverage, now run
  conditionally given successful execution of a basic test environment and
  the linter checks. This change also prevents code coverage prompts from
  appearing twice, with incomplete information on the first time. (`#1350 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1350>`__)
- Added a helper function that takes an iterable and creates a `dict` with
  physical types as keys and the corresponding objects from that iterable
  as values. This change updates the minimum required version of Astropy_
  to 4.3.1. (`#1360 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1360>`__)
- Added the module ``plasmapy.particles._factory`` which contains a
  private function that accepts arguments that can be provided to
  |Particle|, |CustomParticle|, or |ParticleList| and returns the
  appropriate instance of one of those three classes. (`#1365 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1365>`__)
- Used the extract method refactoring pattern on the initialization of
  |Particle| objects. (`#1366 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1366>`__, `#1368 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1368>`__)
- Refactored tests in `plasmapy.particles`. (`#1369 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1369>`__)
- |CustomParticle| and |DimensionlessParticle| no longer emit a warning
  when the charge and/or mass is not provided and got assigned a value of
  |nan| in the appropriate units. (`#1399 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1399>`__)
- Added unit test cases for manual entry of vector values in order to improve code coverage
  in the null point finder. (`#1427 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1427>`__)
- Consolidated and parametrized tests associated with
  ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.gyroradius``. (`#1430 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1430>`__)
- Within `plasmapy.particles` modules, the ``_elements``, ``_isotopes``,
  ``_parsing``, and ``_special_particles`` modules are now imported
  directly. Before this, objects within these modules were typically
  imported. (`#1440 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1440>`__)
- Renamed objects within the source code for `plasmapy.particles` to
  conform with :pep:`8` naming conventions (e.g., ``ParticleZooClass``
  → ``ParticleZoo``, ``ParticleZoo`` → ``particle_zoo``, and ``Particles``
  → ``particles``). (`#1440 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1440>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from `Sourcery <https://sourcery.ai/>`__
  to `plasmapy.utils`. (`#1463 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1463>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from
  `Sourcery <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.plasma`. (`#1464 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1464>`__)
- Bumped the minimum version of `h5py` to ``3.0.0``. (`#1465 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1465>`__)
- Changed the raised exception to `ImportError` (from a general `Exception`)
  when attempting to import `plasmapy` from a Python version below the
  minimum supported version. (`#1465 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1465>`__)
- Added a workflow to label pull requests based on size. (`#1467 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1467>`__, `#1492 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1492>`__)
- Separated ``plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.null_point_find`` into
  two functions named
  `~plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.null_point_find` and
  `plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.uniform_null_point_find`.
  `~plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.null_point_find` finds
  the null points of a vector space whose values are manually
  entered.  `plasmapy.analysis.nullpoint.uniform_null_point_find`
  finds the null points of a uniform vector space whose values
  are generated by a function provided by the user. (`#1477 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1477>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from
  `Sourcery <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.particles`. (`#1479 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1479>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from
  `Sourcery <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.formulary`. (`#1480 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1480>`__)
- Bumped the minimum versions of |mpmath|_ to ``1.2.1``, `numpy` to
  ``1.19.0``, `pandas` to ``1.0.0``, `pytest` to ``5.4.0``, `scipy` to
  ``1.5.0``, and |xarray|_ to ``0.15.0``. (`#1482 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Moved |h5py|_, |lmfit|_, |mpmath|_, and |numba|_ out of the ``extras``
  requirements category and into the ``install`` requirements category.
  These packages are now installed when running ``pip install plasmapy``. (`#1482 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Added ``dlint``, flake8_, ``flake8-absolute-import``,
  ``flake8-rst-docstrings``, ``flake8-use-fstring``,
  pydocstyle_, and pygments_ into the ``tests`` requirements category and
  pre-commit_ into the ``extras`` requirements category. These
  dependencies are not required for basic installation with pip_. (`#1482 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Updated :file:`docs/environment.yml` to use pip_ to install all
  requirements specified by :file:`requirements.txt` when creating a
  Conda_ environment. (`#1482 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1482>`__)
- Used `codespell <https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell>`__
  to fix typos. (`#1493 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1493>`__)
- Used `contextlib.suppress` to suppress exceptions, instead of ``try`` &
  ``except`` blocks. (`#1494 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1494>`__)
- Added a pre-commit_ hook that transforms relative imports to absolute
  imports, except in :file:`docs/plasmapy_sphinx`. (`#1499 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1499>`__)
- Added a test that ``import plasmapy`` does not raise an exception. (`#1501 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1501>`__)
- Added a GitHub Action for `codespell
  <https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell>`__, and updated the
  corresponding tox_ environment to print out contextual information. (`#1530 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1530>`__)
- Added :file:`plasmapy/utils/units_definitions.py` to precompute units
  which were applied to optimize functionality in
  :file:`plasmapy/formulary/distribution.py`. (`#1531 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1531>`__)
- Replaced ``except Exception`` clauses in ``formulary``, ``particles``, and ``utils`` with specific exception statements. (`#1541 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1541>`__)
- Added tests for passing array valued ``k`` and ``theta`` arguments
  to :func:`~plasmapy.dispersion.numerical.hollweg_.hollweg`, which was
  an added feature in :pr:`1529`. (`#1549 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1549>`__)
- Added `flake8-implicit-str-concat
  <https://github.com/flake8-implicit-str-concat/flake8-implicit-str-concat>`__
  and `flake8-mutable <https://github.com/ebeweber/flake8-mutable>`__
  as extensions for flake8_. (`#1557 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1557>`__)
- Added `flake8-simplify <https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify>`__
  as an extension for flake8_. (`#1558 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1558>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from
  `Sourcery <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.dispersion`. (`#1562 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1562>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from
  `Sourcery <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.diagnostics`. (`#1563 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1563>`__)
- Applied automated refactorings from
  `Sourcery <https://sourcery.ai/>`__ to `plasmapy.analysis`. (`#1564 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1564>`__)
- Removed an extraneous `print` statement from
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.frequencies.frequencies.collision_frequency` that
  activated when the colliding particles were both electrons. (`#1570 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1570>`__)
- Changed the type hints for ``z_mean`` in `plasmapy.formulary.collisions`
  functions from ``astropy.units.dimensionless_unscaled`` to
  `~numbers.Real`. Consequently, ``z_mean`` will no longer be processed by
  `~plasmapy.utils.decorators.validators.validate_quantities`. Previously,
  ``z_mean`` issued a warning when a real number was provided instead of a
  dimensionless |Quantity|. (`#1570 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1570>`__)
- Updated the version of black_ to 22.3.0 in PlasmaPy's pre-commit_
  configuration. This update included a formatting change where spaces
  around power operators were removed for sufficiently simple operands
  (e.g., ``a ** b`` → ``a**b``). (`#1582 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1582>`__)
- Renamed ``units_definitions`` to ``_units_definitions`` and
  ``units_helpers`` to ``_units_helpers`` in `plasmapy.utils` to mark
  these modules as private. (`#1587 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1587>`__)
- Updated the :file:`codemeta.json` file with metadata for the
  version ``0.8.1`` release. (`#1606 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1606>`__)


Plasmapy v0.7.0 (2021-11-18)
============================

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- Removed alias ``tfds_`` to
  ``plasmapy.dispersion.two_fluid_dispersion.two_fluid_dispersion_solution``,
  with the reasoning behind the removal outlined in the pull request. (`#1101 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1101>`__)
- Removed the ``Tracker.synthetic_radiograph()`` method and created the
  standalone function
  :func:`~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.synthetic_radiograph`
  in its place.  This new function takes either a
  `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.Tracker` object or
  a dictionary equivalent to
  `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.Tracker.results_dict`. (`#1134 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1134>`__)
- Renamed subpackage ``plasmapy.diagnostics.proton_radiography`` to
  `plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography`, and renamed the
  ``SyntheticProtonRadiograph`` class within that module to
  `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.Tracker`. (`#1134 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1134>`__)
- `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.Tracker` no longer
  supports making changes to an instantiated object and
  re-running the simulation.  Subsequent simulations should be performed
  by instantiating a new
  `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.Tracker` object and
  running its simulation. (`#1134 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1134>`__)
- For `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid` the
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid.volume_averaged_interpolator`
  now returns `numpy.nan` values for any interpolation not bounded by
  the grid points. (`#1173 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1173>`__)
- Renamed file :file:`two_fluid_dispersion.py` to :file:`two_fluid_.py`
  and moved it into the `plasmapy.dispersion.analytical` subpackage.  The
  function ``two_fluid_dispersion_solution()`` contained within that file
  was renamed to `~plasmapy.dispersion.analytical.two_fluid_.two_fluid`. (`#1208 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1208>`__)
- Changed |ParticleList| so that if it is provided with no arguments, then it creates
  an empty |ParticleList|.  This behavior is analogous to how `list` and `tuple` work. (`#1223 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1223>`__)
- Changed the behavior of |Particle| in equality comparisons. Comparing a
  |Particle| with an object that is not :term:`particle-like` will now
  return `False` instead of raising a `TypeError`. (`#1225 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1225>`__)
- Changed the behavior of `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.CustomParticle`
  so that it returns `False` when compared for equality with another type.
  Previously, a `TypeError` was raised. (`#1315 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1315>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- In `plasmapy.particles`, use of the term "integer charge" has
  been deprecated in favor of the term "charge number". The
  `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle.integer_charge` attribute
  of |Particle| has been deprecated in favor of
  `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle.charge_number`. The
  `~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonicLevel.integer_charge`
  attribute of |IonicLevel| (formerly ``IonicFraction``) has been
  deprecated in favor of
  `~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonicLevel.charge_number`. The
  `~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonizationState.integer_charges`
  attribute of |IonizationState| has been deprecated in favor of
  `~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonizationState.charge_numbers`. (`#1136 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1136>`__)
- The ``particle`` attribute of |Particle|
  has been removed after having been deprecated in 0.6.0. (`#1146 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1146>`__)
- Use more generalized keyword argument ``T`` instead of ``T_i`` in ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.gyroradius``.
  The ``T_i`` argument has been deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release. (`#1210 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1210>`__)


Features
--------

- Add the `~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonizationState.average_ion`
  method to |IonizationState|. (`#1028 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1028>`__)
- Added the
  `~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state_collection.IonizationStateCollection.average_ion`
  method to |IonizationStateCollection|. (`#1028 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1028>`__)
- Added the ``plasmapy.formulary.mathematics.Chandrasekhar_G`` function, which is
  helpful in neoclassical transport theory. This change was
  reverted in `#1233 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1233>`__. (`#1084 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1084>`__)
- Enabled slicing of |IonizationState| instances to return a list of
  |IonicLevel| instances. (`#1130 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1130>`__)
- |IonizationState| instances can now be compared to an |IonizationState|
  of a different element without raising an exception. (`#1130 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1130>`__)
- Allowed `len` to be used on |IonizationState| instances. (`#1130 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1130>`__)
- |IonicLevel| and |IonizationState| now accept an additional, optional ion
  temperature argument for each of the ionic levels. (`#1130 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1130>`__)
- Added the
  :meth:`~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.Tracker.save_results`
  method to `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.Tracker`
  for saving results to the :file:`.npz` file format (see `numpy.lib.format` for
  details on the file format). (`#1134 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1134>`__)
- Added the `plasmapy.utils.decorators.deprecation` module. The module includes
  `~plasmapy.utils.decorators.deprecation.deprecated`, which is a decorator that
  is based on `astropy.utils.decorators.deprecated`. (`#1136 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1136>`__)
- Created the `~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonizationState.to_list`
  method of |IonizationState| to provide a |ParticleList| instance that
  contains the different ionic levels. (`#1154 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1154>`__)
- The behavior of the function ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.gyroradius`` has
  been changed. If `numpy.nan` values are provided for ``T_i`` or ``Vperp``,
  then instead of raising a slightly misleading error, `numpy.nan` in the
  appropriate units is returned. (`#1187 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1187>`__)
- Added the `~plasmapy.particles.particle_collections.ParticleList.average_particle`
  method to |ParticleList|. This method returns a particle with the mean mass and
  charge of the |ParticleList|. The ``use_rms_charge`` and ``use_rms_mass`` keyword
  arguments make this method calculate the root mean square charge and mass, respectively.
  The ``abundances`` keyword argument allows the calculation of the mean or root
  mean square to be weighted. (`#1204 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1204>`__)
- Restructured the `plasmapy.dispersion` subpackage by creating the
  `~plasmapy.dispersion.analytical` subpackage to contain functionality
  related to analytical dispersion solutions. (`#1208 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1208>`__)
- Implemented ``__eq__``, ``__ne__`` and ``__hash__`` to allow
  |CustomParticle| instances to be used as `dict` keys. (`#1216 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1216>`__)
- Added the `~plasmapy.particles.particle_collections.ionic_levels` function to create a
  |ParticleList| initialized with different ionic levels of an element or isotope. (`#1223 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1223>`__)


Bug Fixes
---------

- Made |Particle| instances pickleable. (`#1122 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1122>`__)
- Fixed the behavior of ``plasmapy.formulary.mathematics.Chandrasekhar_G``
  at very small and very large argument values. This change was reverted
  in `#1233 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1233>`__. (`#1125 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1125>`__)
- Running `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.synthetic_radiograph`
  with the keyword ``optical_density=True`` will now return `numpy.inf`
  where the source profile intensity is zero. Previously, an incorrect value
  was returned since zero entries were replaced with values of ``1`` before
  taking the logarithm. (`#1134 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1134>`__)
- Fixed a bug in the volume-averaged interpolator for
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid`
  (`~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid.volume_averaged_interpolator`).
  The old method miss interpreted where the interpolation point was
  inside the nearest neighbor cell volume. So, if an interpolation point
  was at the lower bounds of the nearest neighbor cell volume, then the
  position was flipped and interpreted as being at the upper bounds of the
  cell volume, and visa-versa. (`#1173 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1173>`__)
- Fixed the normalization of the wavevector in the Thomson spectral
  density function,
  :func:`~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density`. The previous
  version was not properly normalizing the wavevector to unity. (`#1190 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1190>`__)
- Reverted most of
  `#1084 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1084>`__ and
  `#1125 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1125>`__,
  removing our implementation of the
  Chandrasekhar G function (for now!). This function may get brought
  back at a later date, once we have an implementation we numerically
  trust. (`#1233 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1233>`__)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Improved consistency of documentation style and made
  reST_ fixes in several subpackages. (`#1073 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1073>`__)
- Added a pre-release section to the release guide.
  This section now includes steps for having a feature freeze about a week before the release,
  followed by a code freeze about two days before the release. (`#1081 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1081>`__)
- Created the Sphinx_ extension package `plasmapy_sphinx` and used it to replace
  `sphinx_automodapi`_.  `plasmapy_sphinx` creates directives :rst:dir:`automodapi`
  and :rst:dir:`automodsumm` to replace the same directives defined by
  `sphinx_automodapi`_.  The documentation was updated so the slight syntax differences
  in the newly defined directives will still render the same as before. (`#1105 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1105>`__)
- The term "integer charge" has been replaced in the documentation with
  the term "charge number". (`#1136 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1136>`__)
- Implemented a framework to define and use common `Sphinx substitutions
  <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html
  #substitutions>`__ across the narrative documentation and docstrings.
  These substitutions are defined in :file:`docs/common_links.rst`. (`#1147 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1147>`__)
- Began a project glossary at :file:`docs/glossary.rst`. (`#1149 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1149>`__)
- Changed the default branch name to ``main``.  Locations in the code
  and documentation that referred to the default branch of PlasmaPy (and
  certain other packages) were changed to reflect the new name (including,
  for example, in the development guide in the documentation). (`#1150 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1150>`__)
- Updated information on how to write and build documentation in the
  development guide. (`#1156 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1156>`__)
- Updated information on how to write and run tests in the contributor
  guide. (`#1163 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1163>`__)

  required to contribute to PlasmaPy. (`#1178 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1178>`__)
- Added brief description about the physics of the upper-hybrid resonance
  to the docstring of the function ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.upper_hybrid_frequency``. (`#1180 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1180>`__)
- Added a brief description about the physics of the lower-hybrid resonance
  to the docstring of the function ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.lower_hybrid_frequency``. (`#1181 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1181>`__)
- Made the function ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.gyrofrequency`` more general
  by removing the indications that it might only work for ions. (`#1183 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1183>`__)
- Make `plasmapy.analysis.fit_functions.AbstractFitFunction.FitParamTuple` a
  property to fix the documentation build warning caused by the release
  of Sphinx_ ``v4.1.0``. (`#1199 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1199>`__)
- Included a step in the release guide to update Binder requirements
  so that the release of PlasmaPy on PyPI_ gets installed when opening
  example notebooks from the stable and release branches of the online
  documentation. (`#1205 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1205>`__)
- Updated the documentation guide to include updates to tox_ environments
  for building the documentation. (`#1206 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1206>`__)
- Fixed numerous broken reST_ links in prior changelogs. (`#1207 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1207>`__)
- Improve the docstring for `plasmapy.online_help`. (`#1213 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1213>`__)
- Renamed "Development Guide" to "Contributor Guide", and temporarily removed
  the incomplete :file:`docs/development/workflow.rst` from the ``toctree`` of the
  Contributor Guide. (`#1217 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1217>`__)
- Fixed a typo in the docstring of ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters.Alfven_speed``. (`#1218 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1218>`__)
- Fixed broken reST_ links in docstrings for aliases in `plasmapy.formulary`. (`#1238 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1238>`__)
- Fixed multiple broken and redirected links. (`#1257 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1257>`__)
- Updated the documentation guide to include a description on how to
  add and cite references to PlasmaPy's global bibliography BibTeX_ file,
  :file:`docs/bibliography.bib`. (`#1263 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1263>`__)
- Added sphinxcontrib-bibtex_ as a Sphinx_ extension to enable references
  to be stored in a BibTeX_ file. (`#1263 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1263>`__)
- Began a documentation-wide bibliography page. (`#1263 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1263>`__)
- Updated documentation guide to describe where formulae should go in
  docstrings and how to use glossary entries. (`#1264 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1264>`__)
- Updated and fixed hyperlinks in the documentation. (`#1267 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1267>`__)
- Adopted the ``"xcode"`` code highlighting style for
  pygments_ to increase color contrast and improve web accessibility. (`#1268 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1268>`__)
- Updated the feedback and communication page. (`#1272 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1272>`__)
- Updated the requirements for the documentation build to include no
  restrictions on ``docutils`` and ``sphinx_rtd_theme >= 1.0.0``.
  ``docutils == 0.17`` is not compatible with ``sphinx_rtd_theme < 1.0``
  (see `#1107 <https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/1107>`__ and
  `#1230 <https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues/1230>`__). (`#1275 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1275>`__)
- Added a screenshot of the link for the `Read the Docs`_ preview of the
  documentation for a pull request. (`#1298 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1298>`__)
- Incorporated citations in the
  `~plasmapy.dispersion.analytical.two_fluid_.two_fluid` docstring into
  the PlasmaPy bibliography framework. (`#1301 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1301>`__)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Simplified handling of package dependencies.  Removed duplicated
  requirements files and centralized them instead. Developer dependencies
  can now be installed with either ``pip install plasmapy[developer]`` or
  ``pip install -r requirements.txt``. (`#789 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/789>`__)
- Reconfigured flake8_ settings in CI. (`#1062 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1062>`__)
- Added pydocstyle_ to continuous integration (CI), to hopefully make
  writing prettier docstrings easier. (`#1062 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1062>`__)
- Added ``flake8-rst-docstrings`` to catch reST_ formatting
  errors in documentation in the linter stage of
  CI. (`#1062 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1062>`__)
- Added `pytest-regressions
  <https://pytest-regressions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to testing
  dependencies, to make regression tests a little easier to write. (`#1084 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1084>`__)

  notebook. (`#1088 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1088>`__)
- Upgrade ``nbqa`` to latest available version (0.6.0). (`#1104 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1104>`__)
- Moved our custom `pre-commit`_ style testing suite to ``pre-commit.ci``,
  taking advantage of the new ``pre-commit.ci autofix`` command that
  allows manually calling for pre-commit to be run by typing
  that command as a comment to a pull request. (`#1106 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1106>`__)
- Added tests using hypothesis_. (`#1125 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1125>`__)
- Added to :file:`setup.cfg` the configuration
  ``flake8.per-file-ignores=plasmapy/formulary/__init__.py:F403`` to
  ignore warnings resulting from imports like ``from xx import *``. (`#1127 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1127>`__)
- Re-enabled several flake8_ checks by removing the following codes from
  the ``flake8.extend-ignore`` configuration in :file:`setup.cfg`: ``D100``, ``D102``,
  ``D103``, ``D104``, ``D200``, ``D210``, ``D301``, ``D401``, ``D407``,
  ``D409``, ``D412``, ``E712``, ``E713``, ``F403``, ``F541``, ``RST213``,
  ``RST306``, and ``RST902``. Addressed any failed linter checks from this
  modification. (`#1127 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1127>`__)
- `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.synthetic_radiograph`
  now determines the default detector size to be the smallest detector
  plane centered on the origin that includes all particles. (`#1134 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1134>`__)
- Added ion velocity input to the :file:`thomson.ipynb` diagnostics notebook. (`#1171 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1171>`__)
- Added tox_ and removed pytest_ as extra requirements. (`#1195 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1195>`__)
- Updated tox_ test environments for building the documentation. Added the
  ``build_docs_nitpicky`` environment to check for broken reST_ links. (`#1206 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1206>`__)
- Added the ``--keep-going`` flag to the ``build_docs*`` tox_ environments with
  the ``-W`` option so that test failures will not stop after the first warning
  (that is treated as an error). (`#1206 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1206>`__)
- Make queries to `plasmapy.online_help` for ``"quantity"`` or ``"quantities"`` redirect to the
  help page for `astropy.units` (which was already the case for ``"unit"`` and ``"units"``). (`#1213 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1213>`__)
- Bumped the Python_ version for `Read the Docs`_ builds from ``3.7`` to ``3.8``. (`#1248 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1248>`__)
- Refactored :file:`plasmapy/dispersion/tests/test_dispersion.py` to use
  hypothesis_ for property based testing. (`#1249 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1249>`__)
- Defined redirects to allow and anchors to avoid checking when using Sphinx_
  to verify that hyperlinks are correct via ``make linkcheck``. (`#1267 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1267>`__)
- Replaced usage of `eval` inside |IonizationStateCollection| with `getattr`. (`#1280 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1280>`__)
- Added using `dlint <https://github.com/dlint-py/dlint>`__
  to the ``linters`` testing environment in :file:`tox.ini`
  as a static analysis tool to search for security issues. (`#1280 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1280>`__)
- Enabled using
  `flake8-use-fstring <https://github.com/MichaelKim0407/flake8-use-fstring>`__
  in the ``linters`` testing environment in :file:`tox.ini` to enforce
  usage of formatted string literals (f-strings). (`#1281 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1281>`__)
- Switched usage of `str.format` to formatted string literals (f-strings)
  in several files. (`#1281 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1281>`__)
- Added `flake8-absolute-import <https://github.com/bskinn/flake8-absolute-import>`_
  to the ``linters`` tox_ environment. (`#1283 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1283>`__)
- Removed unused imports, and changed several imports from relative to absolute. (`#1283 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1283>`__)
- Added `pre-commit`_ hooks to auto-format :file:`.ini`,
  :file:`.toml`, and :file:`.yaml` files, and applied changes from
  those hooks to existing files. (`#1284 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1284>`__)
- Changed the validated units for the ``theta`` input argument of
  `~plasmapy.dispersion.analytical.two_fluid_.two_fluid` from degrees to
  radians. (`#1301 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1301>`__)
- Replaced usage of ``distutils.version.StrictVersion`` with
  ``packaging.version.Version`` because ``distutils`` has been deprecated.
  As part of this change, `packaging <https://packaging.pypa.io>`__ has been
  added as a dependency. (`#1306 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1306>`__)
- Increased the minimum version of matplotlib to 3.3.0 and updated
  `plasmapy.diagnostics.langmuir.swept_probe_analysis` to be compatible
  with matplotlib 3.5.0. (`#1334 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1334>`__)


Plasmapy v0.6.0 (2021-03-14)
============================

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- The ``State`` namedtuple was changed to the `~plasmapy.particles.IonicFraction`
  class. (Note: #1046 subsequently changed that to
  `~plasmapy.particles.IonicLevel`). (`#796 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/796>`__)
- Now, when the `~plasmapy.particles.IonizationState` class is provided with an ion,
  the ionic fraction for that ion is set to 100% for the corresponding element or
  isotope. (`#796 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/796>`__)
- ``AtomicError`` was renamed to `~plasmapy.particles.exceptions.ParticleError`
  and ``MissingAtomicDataError`` was renamed to
  `~plasmapy.particles.exceptions.MissingParticleDataError`. (`#796 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/796>`__)
- In `plasmapy.particles`, the ``IonizationStates`` class was renamed to
  `~plasmapy.particles.IonizationStateCollection`.  Argument ``n`` of
  ``IonizationStates`` was changed to ``n0`` in
  `~plasmapy.particles.IonizationStateCollection`. (`#796 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/796>`__)
- Moved and refactored error message formatting functionality from
  ``plasmapy.utils.error_messages`` to `plasmapy.utils.code_repr`. (`#920 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/920>`__)
- Renamed the available "methods" for computing the Coulomb logarithm in an attempt
  to make the names more explicit.  This is implemented using the ``method`` keyword
  for functions `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.coulomb.Coulomb_logarithm` and
  `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.lengths.impact_parameter`, and then propagated throughout
  the functionality in `plasmapy.formulary.collisions`. (`#962 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/962>`__)
- Add dependency ``pandas >= 1.0.0``.  Modify |xarray|_ dependency to be
  ``xarray >= 0.14.0``. (`#963 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/963>`__)
- The `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid` property
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid.grid` is now dimensioned (has units) and
  cannot be accessed if all dimensions do not share the same units. (`#981 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/981>`__)
- Renamed attribute ``is_uniform_grid`` on `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid`
  to ``is_uniform``. (`#981 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/981>`__)
- Drop Python 3.6 support. (`#987 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/987>`__)
- The ``__getitem__`` method of `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid` now returns
  a `~astropy.units.Quantity` array instead of a reference to a `xarray.DataArray`. (`#1027 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1027>`__)
- Renamed `IonicFraction` to `~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonicLevel`.
  This lays groundwork for future changes, where that class is going to become
  more than a fraction. (`#1046 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1046>`__)


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- The ``particle`` attribute of `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle`
  has been deprecated in favor of the new ``symbol`` attribute.  The ``particle``
  attribute now issues a `FutureWarning` to indicate that it will be removed in
  a future release. (`#984 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/984>`__)


Features
--------

- Created the `~plasmapy.simulation.abstractions.AbstractNormalizations` class
  to serve as an abstract interface for future classes that represent normalizations. (`#859 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/859>`__)
- Create the analysis sub-package `plasmapy.analysis.swept_langmuir` for analysis
  code related to analyzing swept Langmuir traces.  Sub-package is initiated with
  functionality for calculating the floating potential,
  `~plasmapy.analysis.swept_langmuir.floating_potential.find_floating_potential`. (`#889 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/889>`__)
- Added a proton radiography diagnostic module containing a tool for generating synthetic proton radiographs from simulated or calculated fields using a particle tracking algorithm. (`#895 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/895>`__)
- Created new grid objects for representing plasma quantities as functions of space. (`#909 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/909>`__)
- Added functions in `plasmapy.utils.code_repr` to reproduce strings
  that represent a call to a method or attribute of an object. These
  functions are used, for example, in error messages. (`#920 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/920>`__)
- Add the function
  :func:`~plasmapy.dispersion.two_fluid_dispersion.two_fluid_dispersion_solution` to
  `plasmapy.dispersion`, which gives an analytical solution to the dispersion relation as
  derived by P. M. Bellan 2012 (DOI: `10.1029/2012JA017856
  <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012JA017856>`_). (`#932 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/932>`__)

  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid` (and child class) methods
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid.nearest_neighbor_interpolator` and
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid.volume_averaged_interpolator`.  This keyword
  allows the interpolators to assume the last grid setup and contents if input
  arguments have not changed. (`#981 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/981>`__)
- Add methods `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid.on_grid` and

  `~plasmapy.utils.decorators.validators.validate_quantities`). (`#999 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/999>`__)
- Both `plasmapy.particles.CustomParticle` and `plasmapy.particles.DimensionlessParticle`
  now allow users to define a custom symbol via the ``symbol`` keyword argument, which
  can then be accessed by the ``symbol`` attribute in each of these classes. (`#1015 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1015>`__)
- The greater than (``>``) operator can now be used between
  `~plasmapy.particles.Particle` and/or `~plasmapy.particles.ParticleList`
  instances to get the nuclear reaction energy. (`#1017 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1017>`__)
- Create `plasmapy.particles.ParticleList` as a list-like collection for
  instances of `plasmapy.particles.Particle` and
  `plasmapy.particles.CustomParticle`.  Adding `~plasmapy.particles.Particle`
  and/or `~plasmapy.particles.CustomParticle` instances will now create a
  `~plasmapy.particles.ParticleList`. (`#1017 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1017>`__)
- Added method `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid.require_quantities` to
  `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid` that verifies a list of quantities is present
  on the grid.  Method is also incorporated into

- Added the
  `~plasmapy.diagnostics.proton_radiography.SyntheticProtonRadiograph.add_wire_mesh()`
  method to `~plasmapy.diagnostics.proton_radiography.SyntheticProtonRadiograph`
  to allow the creation of synthetic proton radiographs that include a wire mesh
  reference grid. (`#1049 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1049>`__)
- Created a function, `~plasmapy.formulary.mathematics.rot_a_to_b`, that calculates
  the rotation matrix that will rotate one 3D vector onto another. (`#1054 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1054>`__)
- Made `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid.is_uniform` a properly-documented
  public attribute of `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid`. (`#1072 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/1072>`__)

  list with a cleaner reST table. (`#867 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/867>`__)


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

- Remove mutable arguments from `Particle.is_category` method. (`#751 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/751>`__)
- Remove all occurrences of default mutable arguments (`#754 <https://github.com/plasmapy/plasmapy/pull/754>`__)
