Added the ``detector_vdir`` keyword to `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.synthetic_radiography.Tracker`
to explicitly define the detector's vertical surface vector. Added the ``source_vdir`` keyword to the ``create_particles``
method of `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.synthetic_radiography.Tracker` to explicitly define the
orientation of the mean velocity of the source particles.
