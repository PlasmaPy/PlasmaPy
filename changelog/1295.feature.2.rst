Implemented non-breaking speed improvements on the methods
`~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid.nearest_neighbor_interpolator`
and `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.CartesianGrid.volume_averaged_interpolator`.
The new interpolators now require that the grid axes be sorted, which is
always true for uniform grids. Added a new test to ensure this stays true.
