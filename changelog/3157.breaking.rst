Development dependencies are now defined using dependency groups rather than via optional
dependencies. Because dependency groups are not included in built distributions of PlasmaPy,
the ``tests`` and ``docs`` dependency sets with current and future releases of PlasmaPy
(i.e., with commands like ``pip install plasmapy[docs,tests]``).
