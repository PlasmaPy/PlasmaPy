Fixed a slight error in `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.plasma_frequency`
and `~plasmapy.formulary.speeds.Alfven_speed` when the charge number was
provided via ``z_mean`` (or now ``Z``) and inconsistent with the
charge number provided to ``particle`` (or zero, if ``particle``
represented an element or isotope with no charge
information. Previously, if we represented a proton with
:py:`particle="H-1"` and :py:`z_mean=1`, then the mass used to
calculate the plasma frequency would have been the mass of a neutral
hydrogen atom rather than the mass of a proton. However, using
:py:`particle="p+"` would have produced the correct mass. This
behavior has been corrected by decorating this function with
|particle_input|. See also :issue:`2178` and :pr:`2179`.
