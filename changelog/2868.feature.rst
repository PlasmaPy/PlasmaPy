Save routines in `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.save_routines` now take an optional keyword argument `output_name`
that sets the basename of the saved file(s).

`~plasmapy.diagnostic.charged_particle_radiography.synthetic_radiography.Tracker` now also accepts an `output_name` keyword. 

`~plasmapy.diagnostic.charged_particle_radiography.synthetic_radiography.synthetic_radiograph` now accepts a file path to an
HDF5 file saved by `~plasmapy.diagnostic.charged_particle_radiography.synthetic_radiography.Tracker` as input to create 
a synthetic radiograph.
