The internal structure of `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.particle_tracker.ParticleTracker` was
optimized by caching some variables (e.g., ``tracked_particle_mask``) which are then reset after every
push cycle by a ``_reset_cache`` method. Instead of adding zero arrays for missing quantities, only
quantities provided on the grid are interpolated, and other required quantities are filled in with an
array of zeros automatically. Particle stopping can now be enabled on a subset of the provided grids.
Adaptive time steps do not include magnetic field candidates if a magnetic field does not exist on the grid.
The adaptive timestep is now set to that of the highest resolution grid for particles that are not
currently on any grid.
