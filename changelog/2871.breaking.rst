The property `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid.recognized_quantities` of `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid` is now a class method
instead of a class property, as using `classmethod` and `property` decorators together is no longer
allowed in Python 3.13. The syntax for accessing this dictionary has therefore changed
from :py:`AbstractGrid.recognized_quantities` to :py:`AbstractGrid.recognized_quantities()`.
