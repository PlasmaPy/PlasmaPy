The property `~plasmapy.plasma.grids.AbstractGrid.recognized_quantities` is now a class method
instead of a class property, as using ``classmethod`` and ``property`` decorators together is no longer
allowed in Python 3.13. The syntax for accessing this dictionary has therefore changed
from ``AbstractGrid.recognized_quantities`` to ``AbstractGrid.recognized_quantities()``.
