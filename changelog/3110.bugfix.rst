Fixed an `AttributeError` that was raised when attempting to set
the ``__doc__`` attribute of the type aliases |ParticleLike| and |ParticleListLike| in
Python 3.14. The ``__doc__`` attribute is no longer set directly because
attributes of `typing.Union` objects may no longer be set in Python 3.14.
This error prevents previous versions of PlasmaPy from being imported in
Python 3.14 (see :issue:`3123`). Calling `help` on |ParticleLike| or |ParticleListLike|
now pulls up the docstring for a generic `typing.Union` object
rather than the docstrings defined in the source code. The docstrings
for these widely used type aliases are still available in the online documentation for
PlasmaPy, complemented by the glossary definition for |particle-like|.
