Introduced the concept of lite-functions, by creating the lite-function
`~plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_lite`, which is a simplified
and `numba` jitted version of `~plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed`.
These functions are intended for computational us and as such have no
conditioning of input or output values.
`~plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed_lite` is also bound to
`~plasmapy.formulary.parameters.thermal_speed` as the ``lite`` attribute.
