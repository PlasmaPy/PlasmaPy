Fix references to the ``astropy.units.equivalencies`` module in the docs. Astropy now considers
this file to be private API, and wants its contents imported through the ``units`` module namespace,
which breaks our intersphinx links. This PR changes those links to a direct URL to the page in the
astropy docs: |Astropy Equivalencies|.
