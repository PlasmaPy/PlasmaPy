The method `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.particle_tracker.ParticleTracker.add_stopping`
requires that the argument ``I`` must now be a list of |Quantity| objects rather than a single
|Quantity| array. This change is needed because `None` entries are now also accepted to that
keyword as placeholders for grids on which stopping will not be applied.
