Began using :file:`uv.lock` to pin the versions of dependencies used
in tests and documentation builds. Previously, pinned requirements had
been stored in :file:`requirements.txt` style files in
:file:`ci_requirements/` that were generated with ``uv pip compile``
for each operating system, Python version, and dependency set. Using
:file:`uv.lock` lets us store requirements information for
different operating systems, Python versions, and dependency sets in
a single file.
