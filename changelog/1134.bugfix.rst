Running `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiograph.synthetic_radiograph`
with the ``optical_density=True`` keyword will now return `numpy.inf`
where the source profile intensity is zero. Previously, an incorrect value
was returned since zero entries were replaced with values of ``1`` before
taking the logarithm.
